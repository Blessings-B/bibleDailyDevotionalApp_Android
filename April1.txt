APRIL 1st

Guilt: The Ugly
We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against
the knowledge of God,  and we take captive every thought
to make it obedient to Christ. 2 Corinthians 10:5

Text: Matthew 27:3-5

Judas changed his mind when he saw Jesus was going to die but he did not repent though he had the opportunity to ask for forgiveness. His sorrow led him to destruction and not repentance because it was not godly sorrow. He allowed the thoughts of guilt to fester and the birds of condemnation to nest in his mind.
We feel guilty when we struggle with sinful thoughts, addictions or habits. I struggled with pornography even as a Christian! The psychologists said it was as a result of being sexually molested. I always felt dirty and unworthy!
Unlike Judas, I did not allow the birds of condemnation nest in my mind. Whenever I fell, I went on my knees despite the `whisperings` and how filthy I felt. Soon, I had no pleasure in those things and the 'whisperings' stopped! You cannot stop the accusations from coming but you can stop it from taking permanent residence in your thoughts!

FURTHER STUDY: John 10:10; Proverbs 4:21-23; Hebrew 9:14
PRAYER: I bring my thoughts under subjection to the Word of God which says he whom the Son of Man has made free is free indeed. Amen!
TIP OF THE DAY: Seek the Lord in prayer asking His help to overcome guilt.
