The Seal
...set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit,
 guaranteeing what is to come. 2 Corinthians 1:22

Text: Ephesians 1:11-14

Have you ever seen a traffic officer on duty?
He/she can be small in size yet command a very big truck to stop, and the driver will come to a standstill. Now the truck stops not because the traffic officer is bigger or more powerful but because the traffic officer is wearing a uniform (a symbol of authority) given to him/her by the government and so the truck driver actually stops in respect to the nation.
Likewise, when we command the devil to flee, he does not do so because we have gotten everything right but because we carry the Holy Ghost who is the seal of divinity and as such the devil has no alternative than to stop.

FURTHER STUDY: 2 Chronicles 16:20-22
PRAYER: I confess that I have the Holy Ghost in me! I represent God`s Kingdom, therefore, I am a terror to the kingdom of darkness.
TIP OF THE DAY: Do not entertain any thoughts of defeat in the battle of life.
