APRIL 11th

The First Step
However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that
your names are written in heaven.' Luke 10:20

Text: James 4:7

Yesterday we saw that a teeny-weeny traffic officer could command a big truck (which by the way could crush him in seconds) to stop, and the truck would stop immediately. Why? He has the Government`s seal (his uniform).
Likewise, as believers, we have our own seal -the Holy Ghost. Jesus told His disciples that the first step towards casting out the devil is to believe in Him, Jesus, accepting Him as your personal Lord and saviour i.e. to be born again (paraphrased).
If you are not yet in Him or born again, there is no way you can cast out devils because you do not have this seal yet. Do you feel threatened by the devil in any area of life? Then this is for you, submit yourself to God then you can have the legal power and authority over the devil and just like Jesus promised, the devil will flee from you.

FURTHER STUDY: Mark 16:15-18; John 3:3-6; Luke 10:18-20
PRAYER: Lord thank you for the seal of the Holy Ghost in my life, therefore, the devil has no power over me!
TIP OF THE DAY: Ask Jesus into your heart today.
