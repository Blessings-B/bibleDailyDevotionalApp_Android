APRIL 12th

The Responsibility
'I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth
will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth
 will be loosed in heaven.' Matthew 16:19

Text: James 4:7

Yesterday we saw that to be able to resist the devil, the first thing is to belong to Jesus i.e. born again. Then today we will be looking at the fact that it is our responsibility to resist the devil.
We are God`s children and He has given His authority to us. We can use it wherever the need arises and the devil will flee. Just as my car key will unlock my car, when I hand it over to you, it will do same without question. Likewise, God`s authority in our mouth will do the same thing or produce the same result as God`s authority in God`s mouth.
It has been given to you. It is now your responsibility to use it. If you do not, God will not come down from heaven to use it for you. Whenever there is a challenge, step out in faith and command it to comply in Jesus name and victory will be yours.

FURTHER STUDY: Galatians 5:1; Luke 10:18-19 
PRAYER: Lord, you have given me all the authority I need to have a victorious life. Help me make use of that authority in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Say to yourself 'I have authority in Christ Jesus and devil obeys me just like Jesus!'
