The Main Key
...that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven
and on earth and under the earth. Philippians 2:10

Text: Philippians 2:6-11
The main key to exercising authority is the name of Jesus! Why is that so? It is so because Jesus brought this victory for believers with His death and resurrection. It is therefore on this premise that we can stand boldly to speak to devil and situations.
In the Bible, it is recorded that Jesus triumphed over the devil and his demons. He rendered him powerless over us and made a public spectacle of him in the presence of his own demons! Praise God!!! He went ahead to hand over that victory to you and I. So, the next time the devil comes or any situation challenges you, remind them that Christ has defeated them; In the name of Jesus resist them and they will respond!
The name of Jesus is a potent force anywhere, any day because the devil lives in fear of what Jesus did to him many years ago!! Use the Name of Jesus, it is yours.

FURTHER STUDY: Revelation 1:18; Colossians 2:15
PRAYER: Thank you because the name of Jesus is mine. I use it at will and devil and his cohorts will obey me!
TIP OF THE DAY: Think of the most powerful weapon on earth; the name of Jesus is many times more powerful.
