Things
...that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in
earth, and things under the earth; Philippians 2:10 (KJV)

Text: Philippians 2:6 - 11

Did you notice that the Bible used the word 'things' three times? Most times we assume that the only valid place for our authority to be exercised is when there is a demonic manifestation or when an accident is about to happen.
No, the bible says things and that means things, if there is anything, anything at all that is troubling you or you are not comfortable with, tackle it in the name of Jesus! Ranging from difficulties in academics to challenges at home to even pimples on your face!
God loves you and is interested in every area of your life, even to the minutest detail. He said that even the hairs on your head are numbered, so He is aware when one falls. If any challenge at all comes, confront it in Jesus name and it will bow.

FURTHER STUDY: Mark 11:23-24
PRAYER: Thank you Lord because I have the Name of Jesus and every challenge obeys me when I call His Name.
TIP OF THE DAY: Look at everything through the eyes of Jesus and see them under your feet.
