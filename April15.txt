APRIL 15th

Knowledge
Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.
 John 8:32

Text: Hosea 4:6

Did you notice in our opening scripture that God did not say that His people perish because the devil is powerful or because He (God) cannot help us? No, He didn`t say that! God is powerful; His people (you & I) are powerful. However, lack of knowledge on how strong we are or what is available to us leaves us defeated. If you have money in the bank but do not know about it, you can die of starvation or fail to buy that new dress. Your dying of hunger or not being able to get what you want is not as a result of lack of money but as a result of LACK OF KNOWLEDGE!
Today I say to you, pick your bible, study it, find out what God has said concerning you, find out the authority you have in Christ. You cannot make use of what you know nothing about. The devil prides in your ignorance because your knowledge of God`s Word places you at an advantage over him.

FURTHER STUDY: Hebrews 2:14-15
PRAYER: Dear Lord, you have revealed all in your Word, give me understanding that I MAY apply them in Jesus Name.
TIP OF THE DAY: Make this confession today; 'I know who I am, I know what I have and I function in the reality of them'
