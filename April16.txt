Defining Prayer
It is written,' he said to them, 'My house will be called a house of prayer'
 Matthew 21:13a

Text: Genesis 25:22-23

Although prayer MAY sometimes seem mysterious, the scriptures have simplified it and made it easy to understand. In our text, Rebekah went to ask God about issues in her life and stayed to get a response from Him. We will define prayer in five ways:
>A conversation between you and God in which you speak and listen. 
>An opportunity to continue in the creative work under the leadership of the Holy Spirit because there is power available for creating what you desire. 
>A time instructions and direction are given by God so that you would have a fulfilling and enjoyable life.
>A time to bring God`s Word to bear in your circumstance to effect a change. 
>An expression of thanksgiving to the Almighty from a heart full of love and gratitude.
God desires to spend time with you because He literally trips over you and there is a lot you can do together.
