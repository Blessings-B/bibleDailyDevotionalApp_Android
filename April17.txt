APRIL 17th

Why Pray?
Pray without ceasing. 1 Corinthians 5:17

Text: Luke 18:1-8

This was a question I battled with for years as a teenager. I was told that God was everywhere, knew everything and could do all and yes, I believed all that. So, if He was all they said He was and knew everything, why do I have to pray again? You can imagine my confusion. Listed below are the answers I found which gave me peace:
>It is an opportunity for God to `spend time with me` discussing and giving me a glimpse of His nature and plans. 
>Prayer sharpens my spiritual senses so I can stand well for God.	 
>It is a time I get charged up to be able to exercise my authority as a believer.
>The devil does not want me to have a good life and this, I can change when I pray.
>It is in the place of prayer that I get transformed to look like God.
>When I pray, I am able to release my bottled-up emotions and get my acts together.
>It is a commandment from God that I am to obey.
