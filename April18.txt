The Ideal Place to Pray
And when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen... Matthew 6:6a

Text: Matthew 14:23, Matthew 6:5-6

Have you ever wondered about the best place to commune with God?	Is there a perfect place to steal away to where you can pour out your heart and know that you have been heard by God? Is it a physical place away from everyone? What if you had to say a quick prayer while busy with other things? Can you pray in the midst of `noise`?
Jesus is our best example so we will take a peep at where He went to each time He wanted to pray. Most of the times, Jesus would pull away from the crowd but some other times, when the need arose, he prayed in the midst of people. The conclusion of the matter then is to pull away to a quiet place in your heart where you can communicate with God without distractions.

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 6:5; Luke 9:16; Psalm 139:7-10 
PRAYER: Lord, teach me how to go to the quiet place of my heart to pray, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Search out the place (even in your heart) where you can stay with God and be refreshed with no distractions.
