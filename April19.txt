Praying Effectively
The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective. James 5:16b

Text: Matthew 6:9-13

I am sure that when you set out to do something, you want to succeed in it. This also applies to prayers. We want to pray and see the effect of it. We want to pray and get the answers as desired. There is a way to pray and be heard. Two things make our prayers able to stir up and make available great power to change events and ourselves - we come in the Name of Jesus and we make requests based on the Word of God.
To come in the Name of Jesus, you have to be in right standing with God (devoid of sin in all forms- unforgiveness, bitterness, envy and the works) else the Name would not be able to stand for you as a guarantor to be heard by God; it is only the prayer of a RIGHTEOUS man that is effective. Then, you need to know God`s promise or Word concerning any matter because your request will lean on that Word to obtain an answer.

FURTHER STUDY: Isaiah 55:10-11; Hebrews 12:15-16; Mark 11:25-26
PRAYER: Lord, MAY I understand what your Word says about every request I will make of you, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Come with a forgiving heart and based on God`s Word, make your request.
