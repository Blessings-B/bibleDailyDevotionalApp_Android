What is Grace?
And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were,
grace would no longer be grace. Romans 11:6

Text: 2 Peter 1:2-3

Understanding grace can sometimes be difficult for us Christians. We find we are often confused about what grace means and we tend to mistake mercy for grace. What exactly is grace? Grace is the undeserved favour of God. Mercy, on the other hand, is withholding the judgement and punishment we deserve for our sins because of the blood Jesus shed on the cross. We have all sinned and deserve punishment. Mercy says no. It is, however, grace that gives us access to this mercy. Let me explain: our sins cut us off from God, we do not deserve access to him. Despite this, God gives us access to Him and all He has- that is grace! Hallelujah!
So, while mercy sets us free, we are not saved by mercy, we are saved by grace. First God released grace, then he extended mercy. Grace, therefore, is this access that we have to God that comes to us undeserved and unmerited that allows us to obtain mercy and be forgiven.

PRAYER: Dear Lord, thank you for your grace that saved me from my sins and set my feet upon the solid rock that is Christ to stand, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Let His grace turn your weakness into something beautiful.
