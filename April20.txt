APRIL 20th
When Answers Are Not in Sight

However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.'
Matthew 17:21 (NKJV)

Text: Hebrews 6:12

Imagine placing an order for an item and it does not arrive on the expected date. You will check to be sure that you met all the criteria needed to receive the item and also call the company to inform them of the delay. When you place orders with God and they do not arrive when you expect, you will need to check your faith level, ensure no weights are hindering its flight to you, add fasting to your prayers and patiently wait.
Fasting is important because it helps your spiritual antenna to be properly directed and sharpened making you more receptive to God`s Spirit. This makes you clearly see the strategy to use to get the answers you desire. Do not give up or think it is not God`s will for you to have what is clearly written out in scriptures. Take that extra step and deprive yourself of pleasure for what is ahead of you.

FURTHER STUDY: Ezra 8:21; Esther 4:15; Acts 14:23
PRAYER: Lord, help me to cultivate a habit of fasting as I wait for answers to come, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Skip breakfast at least once a week to pray.
