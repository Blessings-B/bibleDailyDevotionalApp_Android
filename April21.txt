APRIL 21st

The Priest`s Office

  I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not
have to destroy it, but I found none. Ezekiel 22:30

Text: Revelations 5:9-10

Do you know that you can stand and say no to a flood that wants to destroy your family, friends, and country? This is because of what Jesus did on the cross of Calvary. You became a priest of God by His blood.
A priest`s duty is to stand between God and man, offering sacrifice on behalf of man for God`s mercy. So, next time, when things are not going as it should in your classmate`s life, stand up, wear your priestly garment and plead on her behalf. In the place of prayer, do not have only your needs in mind; also come bearing the burden of others, as the priests of old bore the names of the 12 tribes of Israel, because that is the true mark of one whose life is modeled after that of Jesus Christ.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Peter 2:9; Leviticus 4:25-35; Revelation 1:6
PRAYER: Father, I thank you for the privilege of serving as a priest in your Kingdom. Show me how to effectively carry out my priestly duties, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Who has a need around you? Bring it to the attention of the Master.
