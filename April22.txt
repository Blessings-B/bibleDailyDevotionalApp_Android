Thanksgiving
Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name. Psalms 100:4

Text: 1 Chronicles 16:8-35

Prayer cannot be complete without thanksgiving. There is nothing as refreshing as a grateful heart. Think of what a glass of cold water would do to your thirst. If your younger sibling would always have time to make requests from you, have time to pick it up but have absolutely no time to say thank you; very soon, you will turn a deaf ear to her requests. We are so much like God in this regard.
A heart full of appreciation will always draw more blessings from the Most High. Thanksgiving is the key to the gates and courts of God. This also seals your blessing and ensures it is not taken away from you. It shows you understand that it was not by your strength that you obtained your answers.

FURTHER STUDY: Mark 8:7-9; Psalms 107:1-9; Luke 17:15-19 
PRAYER: Father I thank you for the many answers to my prayers; let your name be highly exalted forever, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Sing a song of gratitude to God today as you approach Him for your needs.
