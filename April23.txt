The Solitary in Families
God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are
bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.
Psalm 68:6 (NKJV)

Text: Psalm 68:3-10

At certain points in our lives, depending on what we are going through, we MAY find ourselves resenting our parents, brothers, and sisters. This is especially the case if the pain, hardship or unkindness we are experiencing is coming from those we expect to be our channels of succour and love such as our immediate family.
The scripture verse for today reminds us that it is God that sets the solitary in families. It is God who set us in our families and He (God) is able to support us through each and every situation we find ourselves in with our parents, lifting us out of it and giving us victory.  The Bible tells us that children are a gift from the Lord and the fruit of the womb is His reward. We are both a gift and a reward in our families, it is not by chance nor mistake that we are where we are.

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 127:3; Ephesians 6:1-2; Mark 10:27
