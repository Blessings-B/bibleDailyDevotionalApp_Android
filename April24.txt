APRIL 24th

Jesus Already Prayed
'I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me
through their word; John 17:20-24 (NKJV)

Text: John 17:20-24

It is easy to begin to feel less in worth on the basis of the difficulty one MAY be going through in their relationship with their parents. The devil will aim to make you feel depressed and even worthless because of the many wrong things you MAY have been told and even been accused of.  It would be good at such times to remember that long before you were ever even born, someone had thought of you and prayed for you. You and your future have already been negotiated for and secured. Be encouraged by the fact that the Son of God Himself loved you and prayed for you.
So, the next time unkind and painful attitudes or words are directed at you. Take a deep breath and spare a moment of prayerful thought; say to yourself Jesus already prayed for me, am not in this on my own. 

FURTHER STUDY: Colossians 2:10; Romans 8:17, 32
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, thank you for loving me and for praying for me even before I existed. Help me to remember this always and to rejoice in it, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Refuse to dwell on the painful words and experiences that MAY have been.
