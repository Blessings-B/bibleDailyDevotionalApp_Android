APRIL 25th

Releasing the Burden
And behold, a leper came and worshiped Him, saying, 'Lord,
if You are willing, You can make me clean.'
Matthew 8:2

Text: Matthew 11:28-29

It is particularly delighting that Jesus did not only just pray for us ahead of time. He invited us to come to Him with our heavy burdens. He promised that he would give us rest. He also said that He would never leave us nor forsake us. He would be with us always. This is a great resource and one that must be extensively utilized.
So, when the weight of words spoken and the pain of wrong assumptions made come weighing; it is okay to find a solitary moment and pour it all out to Jesus. To cry if you must, rage at it all if you feel like; committing it all and casting it all on Jesus. Like the leper who even though so ill and ostracised still came, worshiped at the feet of Jesus and received his healing, you and I should come to Jesus with our burdens and cast it all on Him, over and over again. 

FURTHER STUDY: Mark 1:40; Matthew 11:28
PRAYER: Lord, I bring to you my pain, anger, bitterness, and all. I cast all these cares upon you. Help me to truly let go of them and receive your healing touch, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Think of kind words you can speak to those around you.
