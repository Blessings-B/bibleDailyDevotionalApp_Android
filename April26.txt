Forgiving Your Parents
'And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him that your Father in heaven MAY also forgive you your trespasses.'
Mark 11:25

Text: Colossians 3:12-14

It would be of no benefit if in spite of all that God has done, much is lost through unforgiveness. It is only in releasing all who have hurt us through forgiveness that we find and will earn our own forgiveness - the grace to move on and excel.
Today we come to the crust of the matter: the need to forgive - our parents and all who have caused us pain. There is no way that anyone will be able to stand victorious in life if they are holding on to unforgiveness. It is clear that this process can be painful and difficult hence the reason why so many avoid it. It is even more so when we have been hurt so much by those we love; but we must take steps in accordance to God`s word, to forgive in order to attain our own high potentials. In doing this, our prayers (heart desires, dreams, goals, aspirations) will be answered. 

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 6:15, 18:22; Psalm 32:1
PRAYER: Father it is difficult for me, but I choose to obey you. I forgive my parents and all who have caused me pain. Help me to stay forgiving, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Think of practical ways to go about forgiving and staying in the place of forgiveness.
