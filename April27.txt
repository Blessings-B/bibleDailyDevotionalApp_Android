Praying for The Hurt Caused
Now, this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. 1 John 5:14

Text: 1 John 5:14-15

A key aspect of walking through with our parents as you MAY have realised is prayer. It cannot be overemphasised; especially if the relationship has been fraught with misunderstandings, confrontation, and pain. There is a need to continually talk to God about our feelings, as well as pray for good things to come the way of our parents and loved ones. The Bible encourages us to pray even for our enemies and do good to those who hate and despitefully use us. How much more our family and friends despite any hurt and pain they MAY have caused us.
Sometimes, long after the pain has been caused and the forgiveness granted, hurts arising from past events continue to linger. We must come to God with these in confidence and pray that there would be healing and a washing away of all the pain. This way we are able to live, learn and continually share the love of Jesus with all and sundry, especially our parents. 

FURTHER STUDY:  Philippians 3:13; Matthew 5:44 
PRAYER:  Lord I pray in accordance with your word, that you wash me by the water and the blood and cleanse my heart of every bitterness and pain.
TIP OF THE DAY: Utter a word of prayer, any time a painful thought goes through your mind.
