A Soft Answer
A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.
Proverbs 15:1 (KJV)

Text: Proverbs 15:1-4

It seems like a generally accepted practice to talk back when you are being shouted at or told off. However, we see from today`s reading that there is a much better approach than that. Next time you are being yelled at, put down, and the like, decide to follow the approach recommended in the word of God.
We are to let our light shine before men that they MAY see our good deeds and praise our father in heaven. A soft answer in the midst of a turbulent situation will work wonders and ensure that you shine and come out on the top for Jesus. Jesus did the same thing you know. The Bible tells us that when he was facing trial to be crucified, His very few answers were tactful and thereafter, He answered them not a word. Try it and see, bearing in mind the scripture that tells us to honour our fathers and mothers so that it MAY be well with us in the land of the living.

FURTHER STUDY: John 19:9; Proverbs 25:11
PRAYER: Lord it MAY not be the easiest thing, but it is your word, help me to offer a soft answer each time and not lash back or be bitter, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Meditate on the scriptures that teach on the tongue and a soft answer.
