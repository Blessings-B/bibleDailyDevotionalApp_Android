Staying Focused on Love
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.
 1 Corinthians 13:3

Text: John 13:12-17

The only way to remain victorious at all times, in all situations and through all things, is to ensure that our focus remains on God and his love. It is through love, that the forgiveness given will abide, through love that the soft answer needed will come.
Irrespective of how we feel, what we MAY have been through or are going through, it is only when we continually offer our parents services, responses and acts of love that the indelible mark of the new creature in Christ will dawn on them and form in their hearts. 
Wash their feet. Make a resolve, that in all things your focus and response will be via the route of love. Faith, hope, love MAY abound but the greatest of these is love. 

FURTHER STUDY: 1 John 4:10,19; John 13:34-35
PRAYER: Lord I offer my heart to you, everything I have been through, use it for your glory, help me to continually walk in love, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Think of the many ways God has shown you his love and mercy, resolve to do same.
