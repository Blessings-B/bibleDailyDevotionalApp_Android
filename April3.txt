Everything Through Grace
From the fullness of his grace, we have all received one blessing after another.
 John 1:16

Text: Titus 2:11-12

We live our everyday lives as Christians by the grace of God. Grace is the favour of God which enables us to access the power of God for everything we need for life and godliness. In other words, God`s grace is at the very root of everything in our lives. Grace empowers us to live the Christ-life.
