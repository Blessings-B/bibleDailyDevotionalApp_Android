A Thousand Voices ...
From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. Psalms 61:2 (KJV)

Text:  Psalm 61:1-8

Mum, dad, church, school, study groups, social media, entertainment, culture... the list goes on and on. These are the many voices that speak to us in today`s world. Their voices can often be much louder than ours and cause us to feel unheard and perhaps insignificant to the big picture. Guess what? The great king David also felt the same way. He had moments when all around him was just plain ugly and nasty but here was his solution; to come up even higher than where he was standing. He asked God to lead him to the rock that is higher than his overwhelming circumstances.
So, the next time we feel the walls closing in, let`s escape to our secret place in prayer and cry out like David. God hears and He answers. 

FURTHER STUDY: Mark 6
PRAYER: Lord I give every second, minute and hour of my day to you. Help me to hear you over the many voices that speak to me daily. And after hearing, give me the courage to obey in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY:  Take time to weigh all voices against the voice and will of God.
