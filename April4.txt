APRIL 4th

Transformed by Grace
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come! 2 Corinthians 5:17

Text: 2 Corinthians 3:18

There is a natural instinct in man, a desire to earn or deserve or merit God`s grace. Here is the reality: God`s grace is not something that can be earned by working hard or by fasting or by keeping all Ten Commandments. Grace has absolutely nothing to do with earning.
In the parable of the labourers in the vineyard, Jesus demonstrates to us that grace is not fair. The labourers who started working at the beginning of the day naturally assumed they would earn more than those who came towards the end of the day, it is only fair that they earn more, right? But the master paid everyone the same amount! So, whether your sins are much or little, grace applies to us all. Yes, grace is not fair!! Praise God! 

FURTHER STUDY: Esther 2:16-17; 1 Corinthians 15:10; Matthew 20:1-15
PRAYER: Dear Father, thank you because I do not have to be special or do anything special to earn your grace, you give it to me freely. I receive it, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Grace is not achieved, grace is received
