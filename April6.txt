The Power of Grace
With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and much grace was upon them all. Acts 4:33

Text: Romans 1:16

The Greek word translated as gospel in today`s text means news nearly too good to be true. The Gospel is not just good news, it is news so awesome it is almost unbelievable. The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation and that is grace. (Romans 1:16; Acts 20:24)
Grace is not just a part of God`s redemption plan, it is the power of God`s redemption plan. The entire work of Christ in coming to earth, dying on the cross, rising from the dead and ascending to glory is by the power of the grace of God. (Hebrews 2:9)
When you have come to understand the grace of God, it will release the power of God into your life because when all is said and done, every aspect of our salvation is the work of God through the power of grace. 

FURTHER STUDY: Romans 3:20-23; Acts 11:22-24; Galatians 1:6. 
PRAYER: Dear heavenly Father, I thank you for the power of your grace which brought salvation to all mankind. Help me, Father, to know this power more and more and to walk in it, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Grace calls us to change and gives us the power to change.
