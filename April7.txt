What Grace Is Not
For sin shall not be your master, because you are
not under law, but under grace. Romans 6:14.

Text: Romans 11:6

Grace can be kind of hard to understand and this is because it runs contrary to the system of the world. The world`s system is a merit system: if you study and make good grades, you win prizes and receive awards. This continues as one gets into the labour market. Good performance gets you promoted, bad performance gets you fired.
Unconsciously we begin to equate merit with grace. There are also Christians who feel that grace means we can do as we please, that we can sin and disobey God without consequences. These ones do not want to hear of the need to obey God`s commandments. They say, 'we are under grace, we are not under the law'. This is not so because grace is NOT a license to sin, grace is NOT lasciviousness (Jude 4).
So, grace is NOT merit, grace is NOT a license to sin, what then is grace? Grace is that unmerited favour of God that brings salvation to all people. (Romans.5:8)

FURTHER STUDY: Jude 4-7; Ephesians. 1:5-7; Romans 5:12-6:1. 
PRAYER: Dear Father, I thank you for your grace that walks with me in every season of my life. Help me Lord to grow daily in this grace, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Grace is the beauty of order under the influence of freedom.
