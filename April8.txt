APRIL 8th

Grace - God`s Character
You must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine.
 Titus 2:1
Text: Hebrews 4:16

Grace is not only something that God bestows on us, it is also a character of God. In other words, God is a God of grace and it is His desire that everyone knows that. In Him, we have redemption through the blood of the Lamb, according to the riches of His grace. We were all dead in sin but God`s character - grace picked us up even in our dead state and made us alive together with Christ.
Grace- God`s character is not just a New Testament character. It is clearly seen in the Old Testament as well. See Psalm 78:38, Nehemiah 9:17. The story of David is a story of a man who clearly understood God`s grace and character. See his response when he sinned by numbering the people of Israel in 1 Chronicles 21:13; 'let me fall now into the hand of the Lord....but let me not fall into the hand of man'. (paraphrased). In Christ, this grace character of God was made flesh and dwelt among men. God is a God of grace and since God does not change, His grace remains sufficient for us. 

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Chronicles 21:1-13; 1 Peter 5:10; John 1:14,17
PRAYER: Dear Lord Jesus, I thank you for your grace. Teach me to live a grace-filled life, MAY my utterances and everything about me be full of grace, in your name I pray. Amen 
TIP OF THE DAY: Grace is God`s power, not just God`s pardon.
