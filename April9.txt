APRIL 9th

The Believer`s Authority
Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth
has been given to me. Matthew 28:18

Text: Luke 10:19

Text: Luke 10:19
The Greek word translated 'power' in our text scripture actually means authority/right. We MAY not understand it properly because just about anyone can exercise power but the question is; is it right? Is it legal?
Authority rules over power any day because authority is legal power, the right to exercise power. Here Jesus is saying, I have given you legal power (authority) over all the power of Satan and it cannot hurt you. And all means all, so the devil has no power over you and whatever he tries to bring your way is illegal and so not right.
You are the one with authority.  Stand on that and run him off!

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 8:9; Luke 9:1-2; Ephesians 1:18-23 
PRAYER: Thank you for the authority I have in Christ Jesus. Because of this, devil you have no power over me!
TIP OF THE DAY: In Jesus name, command every situation to align with the Word of the Lord.
