Dealing with The Guilt and Shame
'If my people, who are called by my name,will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.' 2 Chronicles 7:14

Text: John 8:3-11

We all make mistakes; we all fall sometimes choosing to follow our carnal desires over following God. But despite your flaws, God loves you and does not hate you for being pregnant. You MAY feel guilty and ashamed, but do not remain in that state or the devil will take advantage.
God is the One you can run to; He will wrap you in His arms and fill you with strength. He will meet all your needs whether physical or spiritual. He has a perfect plan for you and this baby and in His time He will make all things beautiful. 
So, lift your head and walk in guilt-free confidence that your sins are forgiven! The perfect love of God will cast out every fear, and condemnation and loathing you MAY have. Let go of it all and let God`s love in!

PRAYER: Heavenly Father I accept your forgiveness and I refuse to listen to the lies of the devil anymore, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Keep declaring to yourself: 'The Son of Man has set me free. I am free indeed!'
