Integrity in Speech
 `Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.` James 3:5
Text: James 3:2-6

There are plenty of verses in the bible to remind us that our speech has an intensity of power and impact. The Proverbs 31 woman had evidently overcome in this area (Proverbs 31:26). Several significant areas come to mind when talking about integrity in speech.
>Gossip: It is so easy to fall into the gossip trap. The first successful strategy to deal with gossip is to walk away. Not participating in juicy gossip builds trust and integrity.
>Inappropriate Talk: Keep your speech pure at all times.
>Response to Insults: A couple of deep breaths and a quickly muttered prayer can make the difference between an all-out conflict and a brief encounter that fades away.
Christ treated the tongue as an instrument. The Holy Spirit can infuse power into this instrument and cause our conversation to be full of grace.

FURTHER STUDY: Colossians 4:6; 1 Peter 3:10; Proverbs 18:21
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, give me the grace to bridle my tongue and let my speech be always seasoned with grace, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Personal jabs or funny insults can get a laugh but do little to build up a person or help a situation.
