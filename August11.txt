Integrity in Worship

 `The one whose walk is blameless, who does what is righteous,
who speaks the truth from their heart.` Psalm 15:2

Text: Psalm 15

Most discussions on worship focus on its meaning or the elements of a worship service, yet Psalm 15 shows that there is something else involved. As written in Psalm 15, the one who practices personal integrity as a way of life enters God`s presence. Proper worship involves speaking the truth in our hearts.
A few character traits of this person are:
>Loyalty to the Lord as a basis for true worship.
>Loves God with the whole of his being.
>Rejects behaviours which dishonour God.
>Does not divorce outward actions from inward character.

FURTHER STUDY: John 4:23-24; Matthew 22:37
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, let my worship to you always be born out of the integrity of my heart Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Attempting to worship God without integrity will make our 
worship unacceptable.
