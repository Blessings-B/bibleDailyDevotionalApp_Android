How to Become a Person of Integrity

A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and
an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart.
For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of`. Luke 6:45

Text: Daniel 6:3-10

Integrity starts in the heart. It is developed as we learn and practice certain skills which we will briefly look at below.
Radical Self-confrontation: A person of integrity does not make excuses or blame others for his short-comings. They take responsibility for their actions and reactions. 
Proper moral standards: This is based on God`s character as revealed in His word and reinforced in our consciences by the Holy Spirit.
Accountability: They decide to be personally accountable to others for their moral and spiritual development. They could be accountable to responsible friends or appropriate adults. 

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Peter 3:16; Psalm 41:11-12.
PRAYER: Dear God, give me the grace to put into practice all it takes to become and remain a person of integrity, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: The best way to guard our integrity is to decide in advance that you will never sell or surrender your integrity.
