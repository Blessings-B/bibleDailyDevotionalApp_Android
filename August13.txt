The Abused
'See what great love the Father has lavished on us,                                                                     that we should be called children of God!'                                                                                      1 John 3:1a

Text: 1 John 3:1-5

At some point in our lives, most of us have been spoken to in a negative light, either by a parent, teacher, sibling etc. Verbal abuse is not a one-off event of negative speech but a constant onslaught of verbal battering. It includes yelling, name-calling, accusing, threatening, humiliating, ridiculing, criticising, trivialising your desires or your person. The aim is to control; it can lead to low self-esteem and it leaves no visible evidence.
If you have experienced this, remember: what was said does not define you. What God has said about you is more important. Understand that God loves you, so much that He sent Jesus to die for you (John 3:16). He has shown everyone including the devil that He loves you. Do not accept anything less.

FURTHER STUDY: Romans 8:37-39; Psalms 139:1-24
PRAYER: Dear Jesus, help me to understand how deep and wide your love for me is. Amen
TIP OF THE DAY: Sing 'Jesus loves me this I know' and believe it!
