Sticks and Stones
'But You, Lord, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high'.       Psalm 3:3

Text: Psalm 3:1-8

here is a popular quote which says, 'Sticks and stones MAY break my bones, but words will never hurt me'. However, the fact is that words hurt. As a young girl, I always wished my mum would spank me rather than yell or call me names. In Psalm 42:10 (AMP), David said 'As a crushing of my bones [with a sword], my adversaries taunt me, while they say continually to me, 'Where is your God?'
When you have been a victim of verbal abuse, the negative words weigh down on you. But remember, God has called you His child, His friend, and righteous. So, when your confidence is knocked low because of negative words, what God says about you should always take precedence!
