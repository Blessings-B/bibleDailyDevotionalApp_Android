AUGUST 15th

No Vacuum

The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit.
Proverbs 18:21

Text: Proverbs 18:1-24

Studies have shown that when a frog is placed in hot water, it jumps out immediately. However, when a frog is placed in cold water and the temperature increased slowly, it does not perceive any danger and is slowly boiled to death. Ouch!
When you experience constant verbal abuse, you unconsciously believe the negative words you hear. This is very dangerous.  Nature abhors a vacuum. When negative words are spoken to you, do more than reject them. Speak God`s words of life to yourself! Spend regular time studying and speaking His word to yourself. At times, you MAY not have anyone to build you up. You need to learn to do it yourself.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Samuel 30:6; Galatians 4:7; Ephesians 1:4-11
