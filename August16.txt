AUGUST 16th

Confronting the Abuser
'If your brother or sister sins go and point out their fault,just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over'.                                                                                    Matthew 18:15

Text: Matthew 18:15-17

Confronting the abuser is probably the last thing on your mind. It might be an older person, someone in a position of authority, or even a peer. Sometimes the abuser has no idea they are causing harm to you as they MAY have grown with so much verbal abuse that it`s become part of them.
To confront an abuser, you must understand that the intention is not to have a hostile face-off or an argument but to restore a relationship.Keep calm, state clearly how the person`s words have made you feel; the impact on the relationship if it continues and give the other person a chance to respond.

FURTHER STUDY: Job 32:4-12; 1 Timothy 5:1; Leviticus 19:32
PRAYER: Jesus, thank You for the courage to confront abuse; help me chose the right words and speak in love, in your name I pray, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Pray for anyone who has verbally abused you. Write down what you need to discuss with them.
