AUGUST 17th

Take it to God

'In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to the Lord, weeping bitterly'.                                                        1 Samuel 1:10

Text: 1 Samuel 1:3-10

In 1 Samuel 1, we see the story of a young woman who was verbally abused for many years and its effect on her. Hannah`s co-wife verbally provoked her to the point where she was in anguish and lost appetite. You MAY find yourself in a situation, like Hannah where you can`t remove yourself from the same environment as the abuser. Hannah did what she could do at the time i.e. take it to God and trust Him to justify her.
You MAY feel helpless when facing constant verbal abuse, but God is ever present and willing to help you. Weeping MAY endure for a night but God promises that the morning will bring you joy. So take it to Him, lay it all at His feet. He will deliver you! He will save you!

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 55:22; Romans 12:19; Psalm 46:1
PRAYER: Lord, you are the helper of the helpless. Turn things around for my good, in Jesus name. Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Pray about that situation; keep praying until things change.
