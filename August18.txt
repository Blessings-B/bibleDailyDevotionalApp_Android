Keep the Peace

'Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult.  On the contrary, repay evil with blessing.'                   1 Peter 3:9

Text: 1 Peter 3:9-12

When someone speaks to me harshly or unkindly, I am tempted to reply in the same way. For people who have been exposed to days, months and years of unkind, negative and belittling speech, the temptation to retaliate MAY bubble beneath the surface like a volcano waiting to erupt.
In 1 Peter 3:11, God wants us to proactively seek peace with Him, ourselves and others. You cannot control others but you can control your reaction to other people. So be proactive and respond in love. When you respond in love, they lose the power to hurt you. Also, take steps to avoid possible triggers of the verbal abuse. This MAY mean coming home earlier to prevent an outburst by an angry parent or taking a different route to school.  

FURTHER STUDY: Romans 12:17-21; 1 Thessalonians 5:15; James 3:18
PRAYER: Holy Spirit, help me to pursue peace, to repay evil with good, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Repay the insult with a blessing, either in words or actions.
