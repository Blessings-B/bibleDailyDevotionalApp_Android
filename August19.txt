Could It Be Me?

'Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing.... this should not be.'                                                   James 3:10

Text: James 3:3-12

When a person grows up with a background of abuse it becomes a normal way to communicate. If I am constantly criticising, threatening, yelling, name-calling, blaming, mocking, accusing and undermining another person(s), I am a verbal abuser. Even if I constantly choose not all, but a few of the behaviours listed, as my way of communicating with a particular person(s), I am a verbal abuser and a verbal bully.
What should I do? Recognise the problem and repent; apologise to the person(s) I have hurt (Job 42:7-9). Fill myself with God`s word because the mouth speaks out of what the heart is filled with. Keep the right company i.e. disassociate myself from people who communicate using negative hurtful speech. Seek the help of the Holy Spirit, who is my Helper (John 14:16).

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Peter 3:10; Luke 6:45; Ephesians 4:29
PRAYER: Dear Jesus, help me to speak words that improve others, not hurt them in your name I pray, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Before you speak, consider if it is helpful to the other person.
