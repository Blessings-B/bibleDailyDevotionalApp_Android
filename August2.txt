AUGUST 2nd

Dust Yourself Up and Move On

Though he MAY stumble, he will not fall, for the Lord upholds him with His hand.
Psalm 37:24

Text: Isaiah 43:18-19

You may be frightened, and your first instinct MAY be to go into self-preservation mode. But this is no longer just about you. The decisions you make now will affect more than just your life. Do not dwell on past mistakes. Move on! God is holding your hand to help you. 
Pregnancy is not something you have to go through on your own. The baby`s father is just as responsible for the pregnancy as you are and you MAY be able to involve him and his family too. Ask your parents to pray with you and discuss what support they would be able to offer you if you decide to raise the baby or if they can help you through the adoption process if that is what you decide. Find out with the help of your parents or pastor what help is available for pregnant teens.
Tough times MAY lie ahead, but you will make it through this! Nothing is beyond God`s power, and He will never leave you.

FURTHER STUDY: Isaiah 55:8-9; 1 Samuel 30:6  
PRAYER: Lord I need your strength. Help me to be strong because I can`t do this on my own, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Search the Bible for God`s promises to you and encourage yourself by meditating on them.
