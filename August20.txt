AUGUST 20th

Graceful and Seasoned Speaking

We all stumble in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check. (NLT) James 3:2

Text: Luke 4:22; Colossians 4:6

I think everyone knows someone who it seems always says the right thing. How do they do it we MAY wonder? To speak with grace means to say what is spiritual, wholesome, fitting, kind, sensitive, purposeful, complementary, gentle, truthful, loving, and thoughtful.
Not the easiest feat but our Heavenly Father always knows what we need at each moment, a word of caution, a word of encouragement or just a word to say hello. We can learn from him and with a few tips, we could be closer to that point than we ever were.

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 141:3; Proverbs 25:11
PRAYER: Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable to you heavenly Father, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Take a few moments to think through your words before speaking them.
