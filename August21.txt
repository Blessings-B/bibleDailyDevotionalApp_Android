The Power of Words

Death and life are in the power of the tongue...	Proverbs 18:21a

Text: Genesis 1:3-25

Words can be so light, so airy; they can also be powerful, liberating, heavy, cutting, blunt. Our passage today is replete with 'And God said'. By His words, God created everything, both seen and unseen. 
In addition, He has exalted above all things His Name and His word (Psalm 138:2). He not only created everything by His word, He sustains it by His word (Colossians 1:17). As we are His children, we have the same creative power and the same Spirit at work within us. 

FURTHER STUDY: John 1:1-3; Colossians 1:16-17
PRAYER: Heavenly Father thank you for the gift of words. Help me to use this gift to bring glory to your name today and always. 
TIP OF THE DAY: In all your words today, aim at creating life, create the future God wants for you, create the sibling God sees, create the circumstances that are in line with God`s word. Speak life.
