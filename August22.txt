Speak Life to Your Circumstances
for they are life to those who find them and health to one`s whole body.                                          Proverbs 4:22

Text: Proverbs 4:20-22; 18:21

There are often things that come up to trouble us; a challenge or obstacle in our way, subjects that seem difficult to understand, mean classmates, a troubling home situation... you know what I am talking about. We all have them. And no doubt we are praying about them but what are we saying about those situations? What is God hearing us say? God`s word is life to all who find it.
We already know our words can have creative or destructive power. So, the question is what have we been saying about those situations? Life or words filled with fear, worry, and death? Speak God`s word about that circumstance. His word is life, choose to speak life.

FURTHER STUDY: 2 Kings 4:8-37
PRAYER: Dear heavenly Father, today I commit myself to speaking life in every circumstance I find myself in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Search the word of God for His counsel concerning that situation and begin to speak that word until you see it manifest.
