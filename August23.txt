Feathers in The Wind

Text: Proverbs 18:8

There once lived a woman who loved to gossip - every single day. 'Can you believe he did that?' 'Can you believe she said that?' 'And did you see what he was wearing? A man of his age...' On and on and on she would gossip with her friends.
One day the Rabbi asked to see her. 'I need you to do something for me,' he said. He gave her a cushion and told her to go outside, cut it open and release all the feathers. 'But why?' she pleaded. 'Just do as I ask,' he said.
The woman went outside, slit the cushion open and released all the feathers. The wind quickly blew them far and wide and out of sight.
`Now,' said the Rabbi, 'Go and bring back all the feathers.'
'But, they`ve been blown from pillar to post, down the street, over the hill. I`ll never be able to bring them all back.' She pleaded.
The Rabbi looked at her sternly and said, 'And so, it is with words and idle gossip.' 'Words once spoken can never be taken back. There is no telling how far they will travel and what harm they could do. From now on, I want you to think before you speak.'
And she did. Culled and adapted.
