AUGUST 24th

Speak Life to Those Around You
Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it MAY benefit those who listen.                                                 Ephesians 4:29

Text: James 3:9-11

Have you ever said something to a friend either as a joke or in anger and watched their face drop or felt them withdraw? Our key verse says we should say only what is needful for building others up. Have you ever put in your best and then watched someone destroy your efforts and confidence with a few careless words?
With our words, we can build up or strike down those who hear us. We should stop and consider our words in every circumstance.

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 10:11,20-21; Proverbs 11:9,12
PRAYER: Father of light in whom there is no shadow of turning, I ask that you teach me to through my words today build those around me.
TIP OF THE DAY: Think about it, have you created anything with your words lately? Happiness, confidence, hurt, confusion. Determine to create life with the words you speak to someone today.
