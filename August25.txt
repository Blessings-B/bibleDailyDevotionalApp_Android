Multitude of Words

In the multitude of words, sin is not lacking, but he who restrains his lips is wise. Proverbs 10:19

Text: Proverbs 21:23; Proverbs 10:19

It`s fun to be the life of the party, to always have an opinion on all subjects and to share it. But like our key verse says, when you talk too much, sin will often not be lacking. A coarse joke, a little lie to spice up the story, a hurtful word or a gossip spread. There is a reason God gave us one mouth and two ears. To listen more and speak less.

FURTHER STUDY: James 1:19,26; Proverbs 20:19
PRAYER: Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O God. 
TIP OF THE DAY: If what you have to say will take many words, give it more thought.
