AUGUST 26th

Speaking the Truth in Love
Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. Ephesians. 4:15

Text:  2 Samuel 12:1-10

There are times when what we must say MAY be unpleasant to someone, what should we do in those situations? Perhaps a friend has a body odour, another is making wrong choices and another is being deceived by someone she trusts. These are not the moments to shy away from the truth but neither are they times to go in guns blazing.
Our key verse speaks of speaking the truth in love. Stopping to consider how our words will affect our friend is a good start to this. It should not, however, keep us from speaking the truth. Bearing in mind the other person`s feelings means we will do what we can to spare him/her unnecessary hurt while passing across our message. 

FURTHER STUDY:  Acts 18:24-26; Galatians 2:11-14
PRAYER: Lord use my words at all times and in all seasons to speak your message and your message alone.
TIP OF THE DAY: Try talking to your friend in a private place where you both won`t be overheard. That way she won`t be embarrassed by the presence of other people.
