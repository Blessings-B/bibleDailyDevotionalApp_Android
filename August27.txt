What Is Skill Acquisition?
You have many workers: stonecutters, masons, and carpenters, as well as those skilled in every kind of work, in gold and silver, bronze and iron-craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and the Lord be with you.
1 Chronicles 22:15-16

Text: 2 Chronicles 34:10-13

Skills refer to abilities and capabilities of people to perform tasks as demanded. The business dictionary considers it as an ability and a capacity that involves a deliberate, systematic and sustained effort to smoothly and adaptively carry out complex activities or job functions involving ideas, things or people.  
In the past, in Eastern Nigeria it was the norm for a young person who picks an interest in a particular trade or craft, to be sent as an apprentice to someone involved in that business or craft. He would work, live and serve that man for a number of years. In this length of time, it is assumed he has learnt the rudiments of the trade and thus can set up and sustain his own. 
Verse 10, 11, and 12 laid emphases on the fact that when there is work to be done, in this case, repair and restoration of the temple, it is delivered to skilled workmen.
