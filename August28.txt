AUGUST 28th

Why Is It Important to Acquire a Skill?
'His master replied, `Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful
with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things.
Come and share your master`s happiness!` Matthew 25:21

Text: Matthew 25: 14-30

Everyone one on earth has at least one talent, unfortunately not everyone uses theirs. A talent is generally useless until it is put to use, incidentally, most talents have to be harnessed. God has placed each one of us on earth for the express purpose of using our skills for the glory of God not primarily for our self-gain.
Few points for us to think about from the passage we read;
>We have lots of opportunities brought our way by God but we seem to have personal limitations which are largely limitations of our minds. Matthew 25:25
>We will be held accountable. For every opportunity presented by God that is wasted, we are being unfaithful. 
FURTHER STUDY: I Samuel 17:32-51
PRAYER: Lord, let me be found faithfully doing that which you have placed in my hands, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: When you have been faithful, at the end, you will hear Him say 'Well done'.
