What Skills Can I Acquire as A Young Person?

To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag,
each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.
Matthew 25:15

Text: Exodus 35:30-35

It is important for us to see that God has given each person different gifts to be used for the benefit of the whole of humanity and especially the body of Christ. There are as many skills and talents in the world as there are people, the confusion begins when we try to copy and attempt to be like someone else instead of embracing and celebrating the skills and talents we have.
Listing the skills one could acquire might just be an endless task, however, you should bear in mind that whatever skill you choose to acquire, you are an innovator, you should argue status quo and create new ways of doing things. Nurture creativity in anything your hands find to do.
We become what we think about and thus we must learn to think like God.

PRAYER: Lord, make my heart and mind big enough to accept all you have for me.
