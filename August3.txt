AUGUST 3rd

Dealing with The Changes
'Martha, Martha,' the Lord answered, 'You are worried and upset about many things....'
Luke 10:41

Text: Luke 10:38-42

The first few weeks of pregnancy are the hardest and easiest. The easiest since your condition is not yet visible and the hardest because of the disappointment you MAY deal with when you tell your parent while struggling with unfamiliar changes going on in your body.
When pregnancy occurs due to the disregard of moral values held since childhood, your growing abdomen seems to be a constant reminder of your failure, paraded before the disapproving stares of friends and strangers! You may also feel confused and frightened as you watch your stomach distend and your legs get occasionally swollen; as you experience the waist and backaches and discover the need to sleep a certain way because of the baby. Finding clothes that fit is often an uphill task. At this point, 9 months seems too long! 
But when you place your trust in Him who said, `I would never leave or forsake you` the months ahead suddenly do not look so bleak anymore.

PRAYER: Lord help me to focus on the only things that matter right now; Your love and compassion and my baby.
TIP OF THE DAY: Focus totally on God in worship and praise and watch Him work all things out for you.
