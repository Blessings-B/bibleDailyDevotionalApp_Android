How Do I Know Which Skill to Learn?

Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.
James 1:17

Text: Jeremiah 29:11-14; Genesis 25:24-27

God has an amazing plan for each of us and that plan gives us a great hope for our future. Choosing a skill to acquire should be done bearing in mind that
>God has my best interest at heart more than I have for myself.
>God is leading me in the path of righteousness for His namesake. 
>Competition is a killer, we all have all individual assignments and endowments. 
>Excellence is expected. 
>The more I learn about God, the more I find myself. 
It becomes easier to choose the skill to learn when I know what I do with ease and what things I am passionate about.
