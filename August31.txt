Levels of Skill Acquisition

David also said to Solomon his son, 'Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord God, my God, is with you... and every willing person skilled in any craft will help you in all the work...'
I Chronicles 28:20-21

Text: Ezekiel 47:3-6

The stages of skill acquisition could be likened to the requirements of an athlete training to be a pro athlete. In the first stage, you`re a novice in the skill and a lot of mistakes abound. Depending on the difficulty of the skill in question this could take some time.
At the next stage relating it to our text, the water level has risen to the abdominal level and requires quite an effort to keep moving. Continuous training and practice become your watchword at this point. Remember: 
>Good is the enemy of best and we must always dare to keep launching out.
>There is more to whatever level of expertise you enjoy at the moment.

TIP OF THE DAY: I press forward daily to the finish.
