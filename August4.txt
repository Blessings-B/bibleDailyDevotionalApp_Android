AUGUST 4th

Dealing with Depression
'The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.'
Psalm 34:18

Text: Isaiah 41:10

Psalms is filled with songs and prayers made by David most of which were written at a time he was passing through difficulties, depression and failure.  Through praise and worship, David changed his focus from his circumstance to His circumstance-changing God. As a pregnant teenager, my situation turned me into a worshipper as the feeling of being isolated caused me to focus on God in worship.
Let God be your focus. Refuse to magnify your present circumstance. Satan does not want a confrontation with strength; he`s a coward who preys on our weakness. Don`t analyze your problems as it would only deepen the depression. Instead, magnify the Lord! Sing of His awesomeness, His greatness, His love, His power, His might. Magnify God and watch your problems diminish in comparison. Paul and Silas choose to praise God in the midnight hour instead of giving into depression at the thought of execution and God showed up, shaking the very foundations of the prison! 

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 10:29-31; Philippians 4:8; Psalm 3:3
PRAYER: Lord my heart is overwhelmed. Please stretch out Your loving hand and enfold me in Your love, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Rejoice in the Lord and do not let the devil steal your joy.
