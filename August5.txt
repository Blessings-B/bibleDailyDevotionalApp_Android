AUGUST 5th

Before Signing the Dotted Lines

'Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, 'It is because the Lord has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.' Genesis 29:32

Text: Isaiah 61:1-3

When faced with a teenage pregnancy, many parents attempt to redeem the situation by arranging for the couple to wed. This is not a good idea and could worsen an already bad situation. Don`t sign those dotted lines as a ticket out of the hell-hole your home has become. You MAY just find yourself in a loveless marriage much like Leah`s. Marriage is not an institution to be taken lightly. It is a lifelong journey that only death can rescue you from if entered for the wrong reasons.
Ask God for the strength you need, depend on Him wholly to guide your decision. Remember Ruth.  She was a widow and a foreigner! Yet God settled her in her own home and she even became an ancestress of Jesus! Hand over the reins of your life to the Master planner and watch Him give you beauty for ashes!

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 27:14; Isaiah 26:3-4
PRAYER: Dear Lord, you promised to give me beauty for ashes. I trust You and will wait patiently for the fulfilment of Your promise, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: It is better to be happy as a single unwed mother than, a miserable married woman!
