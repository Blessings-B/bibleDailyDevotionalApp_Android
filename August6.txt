What is Integrity?
`The one whose walk is blameless, who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from their heart;` Psalm 15:2

Text: Psalm 15:1-5

Our society is in dire need of men and women of integrity who exhibit moral courage and treat people fairly and honestly. Integrity is the parent of character; character, the guard of reputation and the necessity for success in any sphere of life. Without integrity, businesses fail, nations crumble, churches disperse, and families are in disarray.
A number of people in the bible were described in one way or the other as people of integrity including King Abimelech, David, Job, Hegai, Hushai, Abraham, and Jesus. These men intentionally resolved to make decisions on truth.  We too can do the same.

FURTHER STUDY: Daniel 5:13-17
PRAYER: And this I pray, that my love MAY abound still more and more in real knowledge and in all discernment so that I MAY approve the things that are excellent in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: A good reputation is as good as gold, but the person with integrity owns the gold mine.
