Fruits of Integrity

 `...he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.
 And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me
against him to ruin him without any reason.` Job 2: 3b

Text: Job 2:1-3
Integrity is like a seed and when sown in our hearts produces fruits visibly seen by the people around us. People of integrity keep their words and their promises. Sadly, we live in an age where a person`s word doesn`t mean much anymore unless it is in writing with lawyers to back it up.
People of integrity maintain their values, they don`t allow the latest poll, latest headline or circumstances determine their values. Job is a great example of this. People MAY attempt to take your money, your job, reputation, fame or your life but they cannot take your character from you. Only you can throw that away. People of integrity attract God`s protection. The person of integrity walks securely and is guarded by righteousness. 

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 7:8; Proverbs 6:16-18
PRAYER: Help me O Lord to sow great seeds of integrity in all that I do today and beyond so as to produce fruits that will be visible for all to see, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Whatever a man MAY build, a business, a nation or an empire, if he doesn`t build his own character, he will eventually fail.
