Sexual Integrity

`Don`t go near the door of her (immoral woman`s) house! If you do, you will lose your honour and hand over to merciless people everything you have achieved in life. Afterward, you will groan in anguish when disease consumes your body.` Pro 5:8-9 (MSG)

Text: Genesis 39; 2 Samuel 11

Sexual integrity means reserving sex only for one`s spouse within the bounds of marriage. This applies to both the young and old, single and married. All are called to reserve sex for marriage and to be faithful in mind and body. It also means attitudes and habits that make abstinence from premarital sex possible and that help to reinforce fidelity.
Sexual integrity can be maintained in the following ways: 
>Quickly and fully repent of any moral failure and trust God for deliverance (1 John 1:9; 2 Corinthians 1:10); 
>Fill your mind with things that are pure (Philippians 4:8); 
>Never allow your mind to pursue stimulation through perverse materials - nudity, indecent TV programmes, and internet articles, etc. (Psalm 101:3; Romans 12:2) and; 
>Never look lustfully at the opposite sex (Job 31:1).

PRAYER: Father, forgive me and heal me from sexual sins which have kept me separated from your love. Help me to flee from influences which cause me to sin in Jesus name, Amen.
