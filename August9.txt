Integrity in Friendship

 `The words of the mouth are deep waters, but the fountain of
wisdom is a rushing stream.` Proverbs 18:4
Text: 2 Samuel 15:32-37

Integrity is the foundation on which all successful relationships are built. Integrity in friendship means that your friends do not have to worry about your motives. They know who you are when they are not present.
In 2 Samuel 15 - Hushai, David`s friend represented David in Absalom`s cabinet, overthrew Ahithophel`s counsel and was instrumental in the restoration of the throne. If you say something behind your friend`s back or divulge confidential information, then you lack integrity. To maintain integrity with your friends, do the following:
>Keep your promises: Follow through with the things you said you would do.
>Don`t talk about your friends in a derogatory manner.
>Be a vault: Lock away confidential information given to you in trust.

FURTHER STUDY: Galatians 6:1-3; Romans 12:9-10
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, give me the courage to say no, face the truth and do the right thing at all times, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: You are a person of integrity when the life you are living on the 
outside matches who you are on the inside.
