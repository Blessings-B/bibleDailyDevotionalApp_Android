Divine Blessing

And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread and thy water;
and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
Exodus 23:25(KJV)

Text:	Matthew 6:33-34

In Exodus 23:25 God commands, 'worship the Lord your God, and his blessing will be on your food and water. I will take away sickness from among you.' God is more than able to take care of us and all our lives affairs when we are busy working for Him and helping those we meet become better people than we met them.
One beautiful song I know has this lyric, 'give and it will come back to you, good measure pressed down shaken together and running over, give and it will come back to you, when you give, give to the Lord.' In other words, whatsoever you give, be it love, healing, restoration, kindness, shoulder to lean on, or even a helping hand to someone in need, surely these things come back to you in many folds. Indeed, serving God allows us to experience God`s many blessings in our own lives!
