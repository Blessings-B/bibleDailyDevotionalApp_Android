Should I eat it? (Daniel)

But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way.                                                                                             Daniel 1:8

Text:  Daniel 1:1-16

As a child, I was groomed to be on my best behavior whenever we were visiting a neighbor`s home; particularly to curb all forms of appetite no matter how appetizing a meal appeared. I dreaded the signature 'stink -eye' from my mother. When I reached puberty, I understood that mother was teaching us to discipline ourselves.
Daniel knew that he had to fulfill purpose, therefore, he chose to abstain, not just for that time in his life but for the life to come. If we must have an excellent spirit as Daniel did, we must propose in our hearts today to deny ourselves of that company or communication that won`t help our walk with GOD. God is looking for a people who aren`t looking for human approval. Be that vessel.

PRAYER: Lord, teach me restraint. I confess that I have not walked in a manner that pleases you and I ask for your forgiveness, in Jesus name, Amen.
