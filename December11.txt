Self-Love? Really? (Rahab)
By faith - because she believed in God and his power -Rahab the harlot did not die with all the others in her city when they refused to obey God, for she gave a                                             friendly welcome to the spies. Hebrews 11:31 (NLT)

Text:  Hebrews 11:1, 31-40

Have you ever given away something of value even though you had more need for it than whoever you gave it to? From our reading, Rahab protected the spies in the face of danger and acknowledged God while she did so.  Her action was purely an act of selflessness. She didn`t hide them because of what they could do for her. By this singular act, she became part of the genealogy of our Lord Jesus (Matthew 1:5).
Can we exhibit this level of passion for the salvation of others around us? Can we make such supplications on behalf of strangers who cannot repay us? We live in a generation driven by greed and how we can gain from others. 

FURTHER STUDY: Joshua 2; 1 Samuel 20
PRAYER: Lord, in this world that preaches so much about self-love, teach me to love others first just as you did.
TIP OF THE DAY: Do less for yourself and more for others today.
