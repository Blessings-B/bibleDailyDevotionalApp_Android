Is the Sex Really Worth It? (Joseph)

But he knows where I am going and when he tests me,                                                                         I will come out as pure as gold. Job 23:10(NLT)

Text:  Job 23:9-12

Just as Joseph said, 'How can I violate my master`s trust and sin against God?' we can also flee from all forms of lust. We must understand that the world we live in today is constantly thinking of ways one can find instant sexual gratification outside the confines of marriage.
The bible says that we must flee (1 Corinthians 6:18). We must learn that sex isn`t a tool we can use to trade in favours. It will do us no good. 
Have you already fallen into this sin? Jesus can transform your life.

FURTHER STUDY: 2 Samuel 11&12; Genesis 39:2-6, 41:33-43. 
PRAYER: Father, today I confess all sexual impurity that has consumed me and has taken your place in my life, either by thought or by action. Give me the grace to flee in Jesus name, Amen.
 TIP OF THE DAY: If you cannot deny yourself of the seemingly good things today, you MAY not know the taste of the best things to come.
