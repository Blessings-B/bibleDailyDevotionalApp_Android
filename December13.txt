For the Cause of Freedom (Martin Luther King Jr)

Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,                                            for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 5:10

Text:  Matthew 5:6-11

A lot of people know Martin Luther King Jr as a civil rights activist who championed the cause against the segregation of black people in the United States. Not a lot of people know that the strength to carry on did not come from being popular or widely accepted by people of the same race but from the place of prayer.
According to his wife Coretta, when Martin had felt like giving up, he reminded God that he was standing for what was right. Instantly, he heard a voice saying, 'stand up for righteousness and stand up for the truth....' So, he forged on. 
Are you tired of interceding for people, your nation and family? Keep going. Your actions will cause a ripple effect. Stand firm, creation awaits your manifestation. You were made for this.
