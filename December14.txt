DECEMBER 14th

For the Cause of the Gospel (Paul)

But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry, which I have received of the lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. Acts 20: 24 (KJV)

Text:  Acts 20:22-25

From the life of Paul, we see a man who was completely sold out to God. He did not care about what he stood to gain from any man (Acts 20:33). He did not regard his life or his accomplishments (Philippians 3:7-8). Because of his sacrifice, we enjoy the good news of salvation. He denied himself of anything that could possibly entangle him (Hebrews 12:1-2).
Today we have been called into the various ministries and works of life. We must strive to carry out the great commission (Matthew 28:19). The world is designed to hate and persecute you. Don`t get it twisted.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Corinthians 9
PRAYER: Father, let your Spirit enable me to be all that you have called me to be.
