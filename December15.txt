For the Cause of Mankind (Jesus)

He said to them all, if any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. Luke 9:23 (KJV)

Text:  Luke 9:23-26

What Christ exhibited on the cross is nothing short of self-denial. It is the denying of self, not for the sake of a greater good to self but a greater good to others. The ultimate self-sacrifice was seen on the cross. Christ is calling us to a higher purpose. The old song says, 'he thought of me, above all'. It takes an unimaginable kind of strength to place another`s interest above yours.
Christ is asking us to pick up our cross daily and follow him. It needs persistence, consistency and determination to walk with God. His Spirit is here to ease the journey for us. 

FURTHER STUDY: Isaiah 53; Colossians 1. 
PRAYER:  Lord, teach me to pick up my cross and chase after you until the very end when you call me home. 
TIP OF THE DAY: God never promised that it would be easy; all he is asking you to do is to put one foot before the other. TRUST!
