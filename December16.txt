Saying Yes to His Will (Abraham)

By an act of faith, Abraham said yes to God`s call to travel to an unknown place                          that would become his home. When he left, he had no idea where he was going.                                                      By an act of faith, he lived in the country promised him, lived as a stranger in tents ... Abraham did it by keeping his eyes on an unseen city with real, eternal foundations                                                                         - the city designed and built by God. Hebrews 11: 8-10 (MSG)

Text:  Hebrews 11:8-12

Abraham exhibited the innocence of a child expecting goodies from his parents. How many are willing to trust an unknown future in the hands of another? How much more in the hands of a God who knows our end from the beginning?  If Abraham hadn`t exercised that bone cracking faith, we won`t have him as our Father of faith.
Our life experiences are but a memory to God. Don`t be bothered about missing out. God is your beginning and your end. 

FURTHER STUDY: Genesis 12; Hebrews 11 
PRAYER: Lord, let my faith grow so I can trust you more. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Let go and allow God to take over the reins.
