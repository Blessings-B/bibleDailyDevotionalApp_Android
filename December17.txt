DECEMBER 17th

Little Foxes

I`ve tried everything and nothing helps. I`m at the end of my rope. Is there no one who can do anything for me? Romans 7:24a(MSG)

Text: Romans 7:15-25

Most of your life, you do the same things you did yesterday, the day before that and even the month prior to that. These things form your habits. Habits are actions that are engrained, that have become automatic because of continued repetition. Whether good or bad, a habit is a learned behaviour. Bad habits can range from harmless acts such as nail biting to life-threatening ones such as smoking.
Can you identify with the scripture reading above? The great Apostle Paul who wrote two-thirds of the New Testament was struggling with bad habits. Listen to this: 'What I don`t understand about myself is I decide one way, but then I act another, doing things I absolutely despise' (Romans 7:14-16 MSG). Does it sound like you? Like Paul, everyone alive has something they struggle with. The difference is that some people decide to take action while others allow these little foxes to cost them something valuable, sometimes their life.

FURTHER STUDY: Songs of Solomon 2:15; Romans 12:1
PRAYER: Lord give me the strength to do what I must, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Think about the bad habits you want to overcome and write them down. You MAY need to ask close friends.
