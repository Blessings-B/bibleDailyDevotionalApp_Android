The Answer

Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!
Romans 7:25a

Text: Hebrews 12:1-3

It is said that it takes 66days to break a bad habit. Most people think that the ability to break a bad habit depends solely on one`s willpower. Apostle Paul said, '...I can will it, but I cannot do it...I decide not to do bad but then I do it anyway... (Romans 7:17-20(MSG). Paul found that willing it wasn`t enough and from what we know of the apostle, we know he had a strong will. Yet this could not bring about the desired change. Paul knew he had come to the end of the rope and needed help.
This is very important when working on breaking a bad habit: acknowledge you need help. Verse 25a says 'Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!' Jesus is the answer and He is near those who call on Him.
