Flesh vs Spirit

'So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.'
Galatians 5:16

Text: Galatians 5:16-25

I used to watch wrestling. I enjoyed fights involving Hulk Hogan, Ultimate warrior etc. These men were strong and muscular. Imagine any of these men fighting a frail, weak, hungry looking opponent. You can tell how the match will turn out.
Paul, in his letter to the Galatians, portrays a picture of a war going on between your flesh and the spirit. Verse 17 of our scripture reading says, '...They are in conflict with each other so that you are not to do whatever you want'. He goes on to list acts of the flesh, which can also be bad habits. Who wins in this war?
Like the wrestling match described above, the stronger one wins. How do these wrestlers become strong and muscular? Well, they eat right, and they exercise. So if you feed the flesh/bad habits by constantly indulging in them, then the flesh wins and the cycle continues. However, if you feed your spirit by studying the word of God, praying and regular fellowship with other Christians, your spirit becomes stronger and you will overcome bad habits.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Peter 2:2; 1 Corinthians 9:24-27; Hebrews 12:1
PRAYER:  Dear Lord, help me to starve my bad habits and feed my spirit man, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Identify a bad habit in your life and starve it.
