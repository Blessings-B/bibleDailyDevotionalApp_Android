Divine Growth

And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.
Luke 2:52

Text: 	Luke 2:42-52

It is never too early to start serving God. Your love for God reflects in your act of service to His people, your neighbors, and your community.
When you involve yourself in selfless acts of service - caring for the sick, helping the homeless, showing hospitality, loving the unloved, giving to those in need, comforting those who mourn, or even displaying unusual kindness to everyone you meet, you are telling the world about Jesus and putting His love on display. 
The beautiful and amazing thing about all of this is the priceless opportunity you have given yourself to grow! You grow in wisdom, love, and kindness. You also improve and develop the skills God has given you as you put them to use. 

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Corinthians 15:58; Hebrews 6:10
PRAYER: Lord, use me to bring joy to everyone around me, and cause me to grow in wisdom as I serve you wholeheartedly.
