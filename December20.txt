Right Thinking

'Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed
by the renewing of your mind. Romans 12:2

Text: Romans 12:1-3

Someone said, 'sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character...'. Bad habits start from the mind. Bad thoughts are like bad seeds which eventually yield bad behaviours. Hence in dealing with bad habits, the root must be dealt with: our thoughts.
Our scripture reading tells us that for there to be a transformation i.e. a change in our `culture` of bad habits then there should be a change in our minds. How does this happen? 2 Corinthians 3:14-18 shows how the veil over our minds is removed IN Christ. Giving ourselves to Jesus is the first step to mind renewal. Verse 18 explains that when we contemplate the Lord`s glory with unveiled faces, we become like Him. When we continually meditate on God`s word, we will start behaving like Him. You can also `contemplate His glory` in the place of prayer. A bad habit is formed due to repetition. Breaking it involves repetition as well. Do not give up.

FURTHER STUDY: Philippians 4:8; Proverbs 23:7(KJV); 2 Corinthians 10:5-6
PRAYER: Jesus, I know it is only in You that I can renew my mind. Change my thought pattern, help me think all the right thoughts according to Philippians 4:8. In your dear name, I pray, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Say this to yourself: I can break the habit of _______ (fill the gap) through Christ who strengthens me.
