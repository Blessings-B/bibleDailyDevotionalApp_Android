Relationships and Breaking Bad Habits

'Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm.'
Proverbs 13:20

Text:  1 Corinthians 15:33-43

Today, we will give attention to how good friends help us break bad habits.
>They help you identify bad habits you never thought you had. Solomon says that wounds from a friend can be trusted (Proverbs 27:6a) A friend who tells you the truth even when it hurts is a treasure. Value them.
>You have someone to confide in. Most bad habits thrive in secrecy. James 5:16a admonishes us to confess our sins to each other and pray for each other so that we MAY be healed. It is not enough to have friends who can identify bad behaviour in your life. Even more valuable are those you can open up to without fear, those who can pray for you and encourage you. Hold onto them.
>Just as bad behaviour corrupts good, good behaviour rubs off on people. It is easy to think you are your own person and cannot be influenced by friends but that is not true. Don`t continue with chickens. Look for an eagle like you.

FURTHER STUDY: Psalms 1:1-3; Proverbs 28:13
PRAYER: Lord, I ask that you lead me to the friends I need, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Identify friends who encourage bad habits...and lose them.
