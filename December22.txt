Put Off and Put On

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.'
Galatians 5:22

Text: Ephesians 4:22-32

The Apostle Paul did not stop at telling the Ephesians to 'put off their former self' he went on to tell them to 'put on the new self'. It was not enough for the Ephesians to stop stealing, but to get busy. It was not enough to get rid of unwholesome talk, but he called for edifying speech on their part. In Verse 31, he pointed out attitudes they needed to get rid of and in verse 32, behaviours they need to embrace. ‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬
Replacing bad habits with good ones is an important step. Make a mental note of the triggers for these habits and decide in advance what action to take instead. Today, develop the habit of studying the Bible, praying, telling someone about Jesus and speaking positively. These are habits that will strengthen your spirit hence being able to defeat the flesh. ‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬

FURTHER STUDY: Ecclesiastes 3:3
PRAYER: Jesus, even as You help me destroy bad habits in my life, I ask that you open my eyes to identify good habits I can imbibe in place of the bad ones, in your name, Amen
TIP OF THE DAY: Study and meditate on a verse of the Bible daily. Be consistent.
