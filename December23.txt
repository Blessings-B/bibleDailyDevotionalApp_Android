Live Free

It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and
do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.
Galatians 5:1

Text: Galatians 5:1

Now that you are free or learning to be free of past encumbrances, don`t take on new ones. Jesus has died for us to be free but don`t push your freedom. Be on your guard. Don`t let other or new bad habits come into your life. The habit of not studying your Bible or of not praying or of not evangelizing or telling lies.
Do not suddenly think now I am strong in Christ, I do not need to do all those stuff I used to follow religiously anymore. 1 Corinthians 10:12 says `let he who thinks he is standing be careful lest he falls.` You have been called to freedom don`t let any yoke of wrong behavior creep into your life. Live free.

FURTHER STUDY: Romans 6:11-14; John 10:10; Romans 12:11
PRAYER: Father help me be alert and on fire for you always, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Stir up your fire for the things of God.
