Jesus Grew

`And Jesus grew in wisdom...` Luke 2:52a

Text: Luke 2:46-47, 51-52.

Jesus was twelve years when the event narrated in the text above happened. Twelve. His understanding and answers to questions were amazing. He was already wise and smart, however, he still grew in wisdom.
God in human form grew in wisdom! So should we. We should make it our aim to grow in wisdom. We can follow the example of the psalmist who was smarter than his teachers because he meditated (thought about and pondered) on God`s word. Thankfully, we have been given the mind of Christ. 

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 119:99; 1 Corinthians 2:15-16.
PRAYER: Thank you Lord for your example; by the help of your Holy Spirit, let me be more like you, Amen.
Tip for the day: Pick a phrase or short verse from the scripture. Write it out on a piece of paper and carry it around in your pocket. Read, reread and think about it frequently throughout today.
