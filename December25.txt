Sitting Among the Teachers

`After three days, they found him in the temple courts,
sitting among the teachers...`Luke 2:46

Text: Luke 2:46-47, 51-52.

Yes, I know. The texts mentioned above were also referenced yesterday but first read them again carefully.
Jesus was sitting among the teachers. 
For a quick 5-minute conversation, people would not usually sit. Sitting down (for reasons other than tiredness) suggests that some good amount of time will be spent in the place of sitting. Jesus spent some time with the teachers who were older and more experienced than him (his human form). As we take today to celebrate Jesus` birth, note that Jesus quite aware of what he came to do, submitted himself to training so that his coming will achieve its aim; which is to destroy the works of the devil.

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 13:20; Proverbs 14:7
PRAYER: Father, I ask that you send smart and wise people into my life - be they in form of friends, relatives or mentors, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: If you see someone (younger or older) smarter or wiser than you, neither be envious nor intimidated. Rather, try and spend some time with them. You will learn, and you will be mentally stimulated.
