Listening to Them

`After three days, they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers,
listening to them...` Luke 2:46

Text: Luke 2:46

My husband`s grandfather thought that listening was a good way to learn and grow mentally. So, he would take my father-in-law, who was only a boy at the time, with him to the meetings of elders. My father-in-law would perch on his little stool to listen and observe. He learnt a great deal.
Jesus sat with the teachers and He listened. Listening is more than hearing. It is not about thinking of a response while being spoken to. It involves paying attention and taking note of what is being said and not many people are good at it. It is a skill one should acquire.

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 18:13; Proverbs 4:1-2  
PRAYER: Give me a listening ear, O Lord, and an understanding heart, in Jesus name I pray, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Give attention, maintain eye contact and be in the moment when being spoken to today.
