DECEMBER 27th

Ask Questions

`After three days, they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers,
listening to them and asking them questions.` Luke 2: 46
Text: Luke 2:46-47, 51-52.

Questions are a great way to learn. Sometimes, people don`t ask because they are afraid of looking stupid. Other times, people discourage others from asking questions perhaps due to their impatience or insecurity.
Think about the legend on Sir Isaac Newton who saw an apple fall from a tree and asked, `why did the apple fall from the tree?` Someone might have said `that`s a stupid question` but that question led to the law of gravity. 
Ask questions, not just for the sake of it but, because you honestly want more answers.

FURTHER STUDY: Ecclesiastes 1:13; Proverbs 25:2
PRAYER: Lord, give me the right questions per time, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Questions don`t have to be directed at someone else. Sometimes, it is a good start to self-direct the questions before voicing them out.
