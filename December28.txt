Cross-Examination

`With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated
everything from the beginning...` Luke 1:3

Text: Proverbs 18:17

In my early education, I wasn`t taught to question books so if something was written in a textbook, it must be right. It wasn`t until I was doing some further education that I was encouraged to question ideas and not to simply accept them because they were written in a book. I found that sometimes, ideas seemed right until I re-examined and re-evaluated them. 
Part of developing mentally involves critical thinking i.e. analysing and evaluating issues before making a judgement. Have you ever heard the phrase `jumping to a conclusion`? This can be avoided by carefully considering and examining a matter from different sides.
Even Luke the physician carefully investigated everything before writing them down. Note the word `CAREFULLY`.

FURTHER STUDY: Luke 1:1-4; Proverbs 14:15 
PRAYER: Thank you, Jesus, for your example both in asking and answering questions. Help me to be more like you, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Before you begin to question and evaluate, ensure that you have first listened and considered the viewpoints. In all you do, be respectful.
