Renew Your Mind And Guard Your Heart

`Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed
by the renewing of your mind...` Romans 12:2.

Text: Proverbs 4:23; Romans 12:2

God made everything - both the things we can see and the things we cannot see. He is intelligent and smart among other things. All knowledge comes from Him. He understands the law of physics. Rocket science is nothing compared to His knowledge and understanding. Above all, He is holy.
So, when He asks us to think like Him and not according to the world, He has a good reason. A polluted vessel will give out polluted water. Therefore, let us guard our hearts and allow His word to renew our minds.
If we want to grow mentally, first let`s remove the weed from the soil.

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 104:34; Matthew 22:37; Romans 8:7
PRAYER: Lord, no one is smarter than you. I humble myself under your will and word.
TIP OF THE DAY: The Bible was inspired by the most intelligent Spirit ever. Take His word as it is.
