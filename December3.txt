Find the Root

'He has alienated my brothers from me; my acquaintances are completely                                 estranged from me' Job 19:13

Text: Job 19:13-19

Back in boarding school during manual labour, I learnt if I wanted the elephant grasses and shrubs to stop shooting up in my portion of the field that I had to take the effort to pull them out from the root. That meant switching my more comfortable cutlass to blisters-inducing hoe.
The feeling of alienation, like those grasses, can also be deeply rooted. To fix this we have to trace the origin of this feeling. Alienation could be personal or society-induced. The hero of our text, Job, had faced a great calamity in a short time. He lost his children, servants, and acquaintances. But because He knew the cause of the problem, he was able to channel his energy towards speaking to God for help. In like manner, we need to examine what our triggers are-separation from ourselves, other humans or God. Identifying the problem is the first step to finding a solution.

FURTHER STUDY: Genesis 3
PRAYER: Merciful Father, I know that you have made all things known to me. Give me an understanding of my life and environment, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Feelings of alienation have identifiable causes. Can you identify your trigger?
