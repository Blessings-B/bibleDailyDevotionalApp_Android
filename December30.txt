Imagine

`Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine...`
Ephesians 3:20a

Text: Ephesians 3:20

God can do the impossible. We know this and so we ask Him - in prayer. However, I think that we often forget that He can also do much more than we IMAGINE.
Imagination is a God-given ability to mentally create original ideas, pictures or things which we cannot yet access with our five senses. The man-made things that we see (and read), hear, smell, touch, and taste were first created in the minds of people. 
Now, we can fly, travel out of the earth, speak to someone miles away, print objects, see babies inside a womb etc. It wasn`t always so. Someone imagined the `impossible`. We too can create good things in our minds. The amazing thing is that God is able to do immeasurably more than we imagine! So, let`s go for it.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Chronicles 17:2; 1 Corinthians 2:16
PRAYER: Holy Spirit, I yield my mind to you. Help me use the imagination you have given me for the good of all, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Use your imagination. All things are possible.
