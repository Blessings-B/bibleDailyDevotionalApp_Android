Taking Stock

You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts
overflow with abundance. Psalms 65:11

Text: Ecclesiastes 7:8

There is something exciting about coming to the end of a matter, be it a project, a task or a year. It is even more exciting if the end is a successful one. It is a common practice amongst businesses to take stock at the end of a project or year. This practice can be applied to our lives too. Think of the beginning of this year and the tasks you penned down to accomplish. It is time to take stock. Carefully assess if those tasks were accomplished. Assess what could have contributed to or mitigated against it. This will guide you in knowing how far you have come. If you think you were not successful this year, you need to check the following so that the next year will hold a better record.
>Were your goals SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound)?
>Did you discipline yourself by eliminating all distractions?
>Did you intermittently assess your alignment to those goals?
>Did you make yourself accountable to anyone?
>Was the Holy Spirit allowed to lead the way?
You have another opportunity with the New Year to win the race of life. However, do not forget to thank God for this year.

FURTHER STUDY: Jeremiah 9:23-24; 2 Timothy 4:7-8; Psalms 37:5-6 
PRAYER: Lord, I am aware that you gave me enough grace to produce profitable ventures in my life. Help me to be disciplined enough to do so, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Treat your life as a business and put in measures to ensure success.
