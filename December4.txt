The Power of Expression

For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth,
one confesses and is saved. Romans 10:10 (ESV)

Text: Colossians 1:21-23

One of my favourite movies is Pixar`s Inside Out because of its beautiful depiction of the power of human emotions. Learning to communicate our feelings is something that takes time and needs regular practice.
In the story of creation, man became separated from God because of sin, and it took God so many years to work out a plan to reconcile man with him. Today, all it takes is a simple confession-an expression of our feeling of loneliness, to enjoy fellowship with God again.
How then can we enjoy the same fellowship with the people in our lives? We can try reaching out to them and make an effort to explain our feelings. We`d be surprised how much of it could be a slight misunderstanding, our own fault, or how the other party has been clueless about our feelings. Just as God honours communication, so do people. 

FURTHER STUDY: Luke 10:38-42
PRAYER: I know that you value communication, Lord, teach me to reach out and extend a hand of fellowship to others, just as you opened the door of reconciliation to me. Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Reach out to someone and share your feelings.
