'I am the way, and the truth, and the life...' John 14:6

Text: John 14:1-12

An integral part of creative writing workshops teaches writers to find and hone their voice. This is because every story carries a piece of the writer.
Let`s take a look at Jesus. The prophets of old heralded His coming. He was to become the saviour. John the Baptist, His forerunner, described Him as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29). And then Jesus described Himself as the light of the world (John 8:12) and the way, truth, and life (John 14:6). Jesus came into the world fully aware of who He was, what He was about, and how to reach the people of the world.
While we might not have all the answers, we at least know who we are in Christ. So, how much of this identity are we living out today, rather than trying to become someone else to fit in with the crowd?

PRAYER: Lord, it`s easy to fall into the trap of peer influence and falsehood. Grant me the grace to understand who I am, and live as you have made me, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: This above all:to thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man (Shakespeare, Hamlet).
