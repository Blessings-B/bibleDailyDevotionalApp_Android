Get Engaged

If you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.
Isaiah 58:10 ESV

Text: Isaiah 58:6-14

Psychologists say the best way to find personal fulfillment and ease the feeling of unimportance is to channel our energy towards helping other people.
The Bible also attests to this. The one who spends their time to feed the hungry, visit the afflicted and serve others will find light in the darkness and joy. This is easy because God has given a special gift to everybody created-gifts of speech and service, in order that God MAY be glorified (1 Peter 4:10). 
Today God calls us to share the grace we`ve received with others in need. This is our true worship. By bringing joy to others we also extend joy to ourselves and build the kind of loving relationship that God desires for us.

FURTHER STUDY: Hebrews 6:10; Matthew 25:31-40
PRAYER: Father, you have made us for community and service. Teach me to look outwards to those who MAY be in need, to the glory of your name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Get committed to helping others by joining a society today. Volunteer jobs are a good way to meet people who need our attention and skill.
