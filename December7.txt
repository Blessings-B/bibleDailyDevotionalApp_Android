In the Spirit of Community

Let each of you look not only to his own interests but also to the interests of others.
Philippians 2:4 (ESV)

Text: 1 Corinthians 12:12-31

There is something special about living in a community and relating with people who share similar views and traditions and principles. It shows us that every man is useful and a part of something big.
The Bible teaches the same:  there are many parts, yet one body. There are many gifts, yet one church. There are many people yet bound together by one faith. This faith is what we profess as children of God, and when we fellowship, we share with one another the gift of ourselves.
Community reminds us that we all fit somewhere because man was not created to inhabit the earth alone. For this reason, alienation is unnatural, and one way to get past it is by becoming part of a community of believers who will share, care and lift us up when we fall. 

FURTHER STUDY: Ecclesiastes 4:9-12; Philippians 2:1-11
PRAYER: Thank you, Father, for making me a part of this household of faith. Help me to look beyond myself and to the needs of my family, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Think on this: Community is about `us` not `me`
