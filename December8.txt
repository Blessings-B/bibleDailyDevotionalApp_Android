DECEMBER 8th

Celebrate Life

`Hear this o Job, stop and consider the wondrous works of God`
Job 37:14 ESV

Text: Job 37

When I was thirteen I took up photography and bought my first camera. Till date photography remains a huge part of my life, reminding me to pause and take in the world around-from the most magnificent of items to the tiniest detail. Through my lens, I`ve seen what can only be described as `wow moments` emphasizing the mighty works of God.
Art can be a means through which we express our perception of the world. Be it through a camera lens, poem or music, our acknowledgement of His handwork can be the difference between joy and sorrow.
Just like Elihu said, we need to stop and consider the wondrous work of God.

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 150; Psalm 98:1-9
PRAYER: Lord, I don`t know what the future MAY bring, but I know that worry can never overwhelm a heart filled with praise. Open my eyes to see your hand in the world around me, in Jesus name, Amen 
TIP OF THE DAY: When we glory in creation, we celebrate God and the works of His hand.
