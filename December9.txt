A Friend like No Other

'Let your steadfast love comfort me...' Psalm 119:76a (ESV)

Text: Matthew 11:28-30

One of my favourite hymns growing up talks about the wonderful friend we have in Jesus who bears our sins and grief, and the wonderful privilege to carry everything to God in prayer.
It is of great comfort to know that the ruler of the world desires our friendship-a friendship greater than anything we can have in the world. But this comes at a small cost: obedience (John 15:14). Yet, the best things about God`s friendship are that it avails us comfort in trials, open access to His ears, and provides good judgment for the kind of earthly relationships we should enjoy.
So, do you feel forsaken? Take it to God in prayer. In His arms, He will take and shield you and you will find solace there.

FURTHER STUDY: John 17; 1 Peter 5:7; Hebrews 4:16
PRAYER: There are times I forget my life begins with you, Lord. Thank you for desiring communication with me and for your attentive ears. Teach me to confidently come before you with my needs and enjoy a rich relationship with you, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Let friendship with God be the blueprint for your earthly relationships.
