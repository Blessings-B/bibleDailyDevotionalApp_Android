HE WON'T TAKE THEM BACK

For God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.
Text: Romans 11:29, 33

God means business. He wants His church to grow to become like Jesus. Then, we will no longer be like little children swayed by every teaching. So, when He gives us His gifts, He does not take them back. When He calls us to do something, He does not 'un-call' us. He does not change like shifting shadows following the direction of the light.
This is both exciting and sobering. It is exciting because we do not have to wonder whether the gifts are still in us. We are sure that we always have them and can always use them. It is sobering because we cannot depend on the presence of the gifts of the Spirit to determine whether we are pleasing God. We must ensure that our hearts are always sincere towards the Lord. 

FURTHER STUDY: Ephesians 4:8-13; James 1:17

PRAYER: Thank you Lord because you are ever steady and generous towards us. Let me use the gifts you have given me to your glory, in Jesus name, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: If you have ever received a gift of the Spirit, it is still in you today. It might be dormant from lack of use but it is still there.
