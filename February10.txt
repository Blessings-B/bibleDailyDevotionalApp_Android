Purity in Relationships - Choosing the Right Friends

As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.
Proverbs 27:17
Text: Proverbs 27:6-10

Relationships can bring a lot of pleasure into our lives so it is important to ask ourselves what the purpose of a relationship is; our pleasure, theirs or God's? We will always find ourselves in uncomfortable positions when we look for our pleasure or that of another in relationships above that of God, who wants the best for us. God's desire is for our relationships to promote our relationship with Him. Keep this in mind while evaluating your relationships. Honestly consider if they are drawing you closer to or far away from God. Ask God to guide you through the process of choosing friends; to give you courage and wisdom to set boundaries in your relationships and to protect yourself from people who would lure you to sin. Never pursue heart to heart friendships with an unbeliever, no matter how nice they may seem. We may be unable to choose the family into which we are born, but we have the power to choose our friends. Choose wisely.

FURTHER STUDY: Job 15:34; 1 Corinthians 15:33; Psalms 14:5 

PRAYER: Dear Lord, you see the hearts of all men, lead me to friends who will help me to be who you want me to be, in Jesus name, Amen. 

TIP OF THE DAY: Before saying yes to a friendship, ask yourself if this friend honours God?
