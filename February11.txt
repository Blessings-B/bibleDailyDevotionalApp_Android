Stay Pure

How can a young person stay on the path of purity?
By living according to your word. Psalm 119:9
Text: Psalm 119:9-11

Purity can be defined as freedom from contaminants. It means you have chosen to center
your life around what is pure, true, genuine, righteous and good. How can this be done?
>Avoid Contamination: What kind of things do you allow to enter your mind and stay 
there? What are the lyrics of the music on your playlist, what sort of movies do you watch, 
how about your interactions on social media? Would God and your accountability partners 
be proud of you in these areas?
>Establish Boundaries: You must not be everywhere; you must not honour every 
invitation and everyone must not be your friend. Decide to abide by the principles of God 
which will protect you. Establishing boundaries in what you do will help you avoid tragic 
mistakes.
>Learn to say ‘’NO’’: Learn to say ‘’no’’ to those cravings to make the wrong choices. 
Wrong choices lead you down the wrong path. This can be a shattering experience. 
Further Study: Philippians 1:9–10; Habakkuk 1:13; 1 John 3:3
Prayer: Lord, I have decided to follow you and align myself to your Word. Holy Spirit help 
me to stand by that decision, Amen.
Tip of the day: Let God’s word guide your choices every day.
