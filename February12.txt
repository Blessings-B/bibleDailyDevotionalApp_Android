God Has Emotions

So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them;

We are created in God's image, emotions and all. Our emotions may have been corrupted by Adam's sin but from the start, emotions were part of God's design. Throughout scripture we see God show various emotions: Love (John 3:16; 1 John 4: 8), Anger (Deuteronomy 9:22), Laughter (Psalm 37:13), Compassion (Psalm 135:14; Isaiah 49:10), Grief (Genesis 6:6, Psalm 78:40), Hate (Proverbs 6:16, Psalm 11:5), and Joy (Zephaniah 3:17; Isaiah 62:5). So, if emotions were part of the plan before the fall, we need to understand them and why they were given to us in order to truly live life to the fullest.

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 8:10; Luke 7:13 

PRAYER: Precious Lord in whose image I am, help me understand this essential part of me and so truly be all you have created me to be in Jesus name, Amen. 

TIP OF THE DAY: How does the thought that God has emotions make you feel?
