Why Emotions?

I was glad when they said unto me, "Let us go into the house of the Lord." Psalm 122:1 (KJV)
Text: Psalm 149:1-9

Emotions are often an indicator of our state of mind, about a person, situation or circumstance. A lot goes into our emotions but the most fundamental part is our thoughts. You think someone is nice and fun to have around and you're happy to see them. You think someone is difficult to get along with, you become apprehensive when you see them. Our emotions are fed by our thoughts. What then should we do with our emotions? We should acknowledge them and then decipher the thoughts that led us to feel that way.
Why emotions? They add colour to life.
Further Study: 1 Samuel 1:1-10; Jonah 3:10-4:1
Prayer: Heavenly Father thank you for the gift of emotions. Help me to learn to understand and master my emotions and use them to my best advantage and to the glory to your name today and always in Jesus name, Amen
