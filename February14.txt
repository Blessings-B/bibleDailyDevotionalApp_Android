Inside Out

Is anyone happy? Let him sing songs of praise. James 5:13b

Text: James 5:13-16

So, what do we do with our emotions? The first step to being emotionally balanced is to acknowledge our emotions. Our text says if anyone is happy, which means you have to acknowledge what you are feeling first. Happy, sad, anxious, scared, ashamed, hopeful, excited, when we have acknowledged our emotions then we can know the next step to take.
'Remember the movie 'Inside Out'? That whole drama resulted because Joy did not want to acknowledge that Riley was feeling sad. When we don't acknowledge our emotions, we set the stage for all sorts of trouble.
Further Study: 2 Samuel 12:13-25; Job 6:1-3
Prayer: Lord you are a God of truth, help me to be truthful to myself and to you about my emotions at all times, in Jesus name, Amen.
