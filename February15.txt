Now What?

But David found strength in the Lord his God. 1 Samuel 30:6b
Text: 1 Samuel 30:1-25

Having acknowledge how you are feeling the next step would be to examine the reason for those feelings. Are they based on reality, truth, assumptions, the word of God?
Let's assume you feel you're in love with Kunle, but what do you know about Kunle? Close to nothing. You set out to find out more about him and you discover that while he's cute alright, he's also not a very neat person, he's a tad impatient and tends to be rude to those whom he feels are not in his social class. Suddenly all those warm tingling sensations begin to fade.

David acknowledged how he and his men were feeling but he didn't stop there. He encouraged himself with what he knew about God then sought to take the next step. Wisdom and knowledge should guide our actions. Emotions add spice to our life but they should not be in the driver's seat of your life.

Further Study: Genesis 4:3-12
Prayer: Father, help me to keep a level head as I live as your ambassador today in Jesus name, Amen.
Tip of the day: It may feel good but is it the right thing to do based on the word of God?
