Negative Emotions

 ...because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid." Mark 6:50
Text: Mark 6:45-51

Negative emotions warn us of danger and tell us that something deep inside needs correction. For example, fear is a sign that we perceive something to be threatening or dangerous. Like in our text for the day, when the disciples saw Jesus walking on the water, they thought it was a ghost and got frightened.
Anger often suggests that we regard a situation as causing injury to our self-esteem. Shame or guilt indicates we view something that has happened as a moral failure on our part. Most times the intensity of the emotion tells us how much importance we attach to an event.
But the question to ask is, what importance does God attach to that event? How does God see it? While Jesus was in the boat sleeping, his disciples were afraid for their lives thinking they were about to die (Matthew 8:23-27). Jesus knew it was nothing to worry about but the disciples thought their lives were over. Wouldn't our lives be so much better if we looked at things from God's point of view?
Further Study: 2 Chronicles 32:16-23; Daniel 4:32-37 
Prayer: Holy Spirit help me to view every situation as you would view it in Jesus name, Amen.
Tip of the day: Always try to isolate the thoughts that led to a negative emotion. Hold those thoughts up to the standard of God's word. Do they pass the test?
