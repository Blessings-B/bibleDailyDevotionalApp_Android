Positive Emotions

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things, there is no law.                                                Galatians 5:22-23
Text: 1 Corinthians 13:4-13

Love, joy, peace, kindness, hope are all examples of what are often called positive emotions. But for us as Christians, they are much more than positive emotions. They are a promise from our Father. Our key verse tells us that these are the fruit of the Holy Spirit in our lives, meaning that as we yield ourselves more to God and experience more of God, we know and experience these emotions. It also means that if we are in a situation which would naturally steal our joy, our peace, our love, we can ask God for his own to guard and uphold our hearts, to be at work in us. We have an anchor, a bank in God of all the positive emotions we could ever need.

PRAYER: Thank you for being there for us Father, a sure hope in every situation. Today I draw on your love, your hope as I walk out into a very wounded world. Let me do as you would do in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Sing to the Lord a new song, a song of praise, love, and worship.
