Not A Slave

For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear..."Romans 8:15a
Text: Romans 8:12-17

It is possible for one to be a slave to fear. As a matter of fact, it is possible to be slaves to our emotions. Not doing anything unless we 'feel' like it. Women feel deeply and that is a beautiful thing. God made it so. But our emotions do not have to control us. They should not. The Bible tells us of several things that can and should guide our actions; the word of God, the Holy Spirit but certainly not our emotions.
There are other times when the devil attacks us through our emotions, fear, rage, lust, depression. Often in these circumstances, there is no logical reason for the depth of the emotion being experienced. That is not the time to understand that emotion but rather to rebuke the devil, to resist him and he will flee from you.
So, acknowledge your emotions, understand them but donâ€™t let them run you.

FURTHER STUDY: 2 Timothy 1:7; Numbers 14:1-end.
PRAYER: Lord I do not want to be a slave to anything other than righteousness. Help me to rise above my emotions at all times and walk by the light of your word, in Jesus name Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Who runs your life?
