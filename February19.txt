What Is a Crush?

How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes are doves.
Songs of Solomon 1:15
Text: Proverbs 30:18-19

A crush is a brief but intense infatuation for someone especially someone deemed unattainable. It is a burning desire to be with someone whom you find very attractive and extremely special. Infatuation in itself is a state of being carried away by unreasoned passion or feelings of love which are shallow and transient.
The characteristics of a crush are very clear. It is sudden; does not give a notice before it arrives and can vanish without notice. Anything can end it; change of location, a flaw, a better person, etc. It is effortless and time-consuming. 
Further Study: Proverbs 20:6; Matthew 5:28  

Prayer: Help me, Father, to be alert to when I am having a crush and show me how to deal with it, in Jesus Name, Amen.

Tip of the day: You might not necessarily choose whom you have a crush on but you can choose how you respond to it.
