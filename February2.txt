FAN INTO FLAME

2 Timothy 1:6 'For this reason, I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands'.
Text: 2 Timothy 1:6-7

God will not be pleased if we do not use the gifts He has given us. Ask the servant with the one talent of gold.
The Lord expects us to fan our gifts like hot coal until it becomes a lively and useful fire. We can fan it in three ways:

 > By allowing our gift to be expressed through the power of the Holy Spirit. Commit it in prayer to the Holy Spirit and ask for His help.
 > With love (in patience, kindness, humility and not out of anger, selfish interest or revenge).
 > Through self-discipline, not using the gift in a disorderly and disrespectful manner. Know when to stop and when to go.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Corinthians 15:10; Matthew 3:11

PRAYER: Jesus, help me not to be timid but to use the gift you have given me no matter how small I may think it is.

TIP OF THE DAY: Ask the Lord to show you how you can use your gift today.
