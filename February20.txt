Are Crushes Okay?

Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field:
Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
Songs of Solomon 2:7
Text: Songs of Solomon 3:5; 8:4

Crushes are actually inevitable. It is something that almost every young person will
experience at one point or the other but it is not okay to allow yourself to be enveloped 
by these emotions for the following reasons;
It is of the flesh: It is completely physical. It is only rooted in the physical attributes 
of the person you have a crush on; the looks, perfume, mannerism, gesticulation, 
etc. 
It is transient: A mere feeling that can pass. It is just like a tree without a proper 
root system. It might grow for a season and then fade away on to someone else.
Distraction: A Crush can lead to serious distractions. You canâ€™t seem to 
concentrate on anything productive. This can drastically affect your studies 
because you spend the time meant for reading and lectures thinking of the person.
Further Study: 1 Corinthians 13:4-7
Prayer: Dear Lord, help me to avoid all emotions that are not rooted in you alone, in 
Jesus name, Amen.
Tip of the day: Crushes often do not produce any beneficial result
