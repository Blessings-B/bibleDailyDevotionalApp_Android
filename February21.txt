What Do I Do?

How can a young person stay on the path of purity? By living according to your word. Psalm 119:9
Text: Psalm 119:9- 11

We have seen and understood what crush means and why it must not be allowed to abide
when it comes. The question now is how do we handle this crush and still retain our purity 
and sanctity?
Spend time with God: Jesus has walked through every pathway we could ever 
come across. The more time you spend with Him in prayer and the study of the 
Word, the more strength you will receive to live the life God wants you to. Be 
ready to share everything with Jesus, make him your closest confidante.
Get close to your parents or guardians: Your parents or guardians play an 
important role in your life now. Those who make fewer mistakes are those who 
cultivate a close relationship with their guardians. Apart from having been 
where you are, God gave them to you to guide you. Even if your parents are 
not available, ask God to direct you to a good mentor who you can always come 
to for help and He will.

FURTHER STUDY: Colossians 3:2-5; Acts 6:4; Proverbs 15:22
PRAYER: Dear Lord help me to look up to you alone for emotional satisfaction today and 
always, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: The devil preys more on those who donâ€™t have an authority over their 
lives.
