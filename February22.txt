What Goes In…

Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything
is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.
Philippians 4:8

Text: Proverbs 4:23

Jesus told us that what we allow into our minds is important. Reading novels and watching movies are good ways to relax. However, if you spend most of your time watching and reading romantic movies and novels, it will be almost impossible to handle a crush wisely. It is important to guard your heart. What you watch, what you hear form the foundation of your thoughts.
You have a responsibility to ensure that only the right thoughts are allowed to dwell in your heart. You cannot control all the thoughts that pass through your mind, but you are responsible for what you entertain as a thought.
