Focus on Your Future

Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
2 Timothy 2:22
Text: Jeremiah 29:11

God has a lot in store for us but the devil wants to fill us with distractions to deter us while en route the future God has for us. I'm sure you do not want to spend half of your young life drifting from one form of emotional stress to the other. Whatever level you are in today; secondary school or the university, set goals for each level and focus on achieving your goals. When you do that, you won't have time for any other frivolity. Your head will be too full of the plans for achieving your goals that there will not be any room left for infatuation.
As you continue on this journey of life, it's important you study yourself honestly. If you find you are drifting in the wrong direction concerning the opposite sex, tell yourself the truth immediately and call yourself to order. 

FURTHER STUDY: Colossians 3:2-5; Ephesians 5:3.

PRAYER: Father, in Jesus name, help me to make choices based on the truths in your word and not my feelings, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: You are absolutely responsible for the outcome of your life.
