Separation

Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom. Songs of Solomon 2:15
Text: Hebrews 12:1-3

Do you remember when you were younger and you were attached to a particular toy such that it was impossible for you to do any other thing? Your parents probably had to hide the toy from you or give it out. But in no time, you actually forgot about that toy, like it never existed. This is exactly what a crush is like. All you need to do is separate yourself from whoever you have a crush on. Because a crush doesn't have a proper root system, before you know it, you would forget about that person and move on.
Time heals wounds and you will heal from the stress it took to untangle yourself from that person. Don't be afraid, just keep trusting God and focusing on more important things; your house chores, school work, church activities, etc. and with time, you will indeed heal.

PRAYER: Dear Lord, help me to sieve out thoughts, emotions, and actions that will jeopardize my future in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY:  Begin to separate yourself. Donâ€™t send that text message or make that call.
