God sets the lonely in families Psalm 68:6a
Text: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8


God wants each one of us to have family and friends. He created us that way, for relationships. First with himself then with other human beings. Like our text says there is a time for everything. The time for love will come. True love, the type that stands the test of time will also come.
Your duty is to cherish your relationship with God. Study and get to know yourself. Discover the purpose for which God created you and work towards fulfilling it. While you are doing this, staying busy as Adam was in the garden, God will bring your help mate your way. 
FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 18:22; Songs of Solomon 2:16

PRAYER: Father, I trust you to place me in my own family when the time is right in Jesus name, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: Start learning how to recognize the right spouse God has for you.
