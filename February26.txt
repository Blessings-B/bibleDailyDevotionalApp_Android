God's WIP

Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you - guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us. 2 Timothy 1:14
Text: Psalms 139:13-16

Have you ever stood in front of a mirror and smiled/ cried as you critically examined yourself? How would you react if you could view your inner self/ character? A lot of people do not like what they see and wished they looked different or were born into a different family.
A dislike of yourself is a distrust of God's deep love and best desires for you. God has deposited a lot of good in you which you need to keep safe by appreciating and treasuring it dearly. There may be certain unprofitable characteristics or traits that you may need to get rid of but always remember you are Godâ€™s work-in-progress (WIP). Be patient with your transformation process while loving all of you.

FURTHER STUDY: Genesis 1:31; Hebrews 2:6-7; 1 Peter 2:9

PRAYER: Lord, you put a lot of thought into creating me and I am grateful for this display of love. Please help me love all of me as you transform me into your image, in Jesus name, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: Pick up a character-building material every day as you appreciate the work done so far.
