Spirit of Mediocrity

'Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities' Daniel 6:3
Text: 2 Timothy 1:7

Mediocrity is a place between `not so good` and `good`. It occurs when great care is not taken in the conduct of affairs; where work is done sloppily, excuses are the order of the day, and the mind is not stretched or pressured to release all the good stuff inside.
Daniel was a young boy taken captive to a distant and unfamiliar land. He could have chosen to live a less-than-excellent life, he could have succumbed to fear, decided to bemoan his `misfortune` and become depressed, expecting everyone to understand. Instead, he chose to be directed by the spirit of excellence in him.  
You are the creation of the Almighty; His look-alike carrying His breath in you! You are expected to soar with wings like eagles and show forth His glory and excellence in everything you do. Life must know that you passed its way. Do not accept anything less!

PRAYER: Lord, you have invested so much in me; please help me display excellence in all I do, in Jesus name, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: Make up your mind to work on your mind every day.
