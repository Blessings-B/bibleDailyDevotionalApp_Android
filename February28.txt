Forgive Thyself

"Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors". Matthew 6:12
Text: Matthew 18:21-35

Have you ever felt like giving yourself a kick when you made a mistake or said to yourself: "how could you have been so foolish?". If your plea is guilty, it is time to release yourself from the prison of unforgiveness. You have actually become one of your own debtors. If you do not believe that you are a good and wonderful person, you will not be able to love yourself in a healthy way.
A lot of us are hard on ourselves and impatient with our progress in life.  This affects the way we handle the mistakes of others. Be a little kinder to yourself and you will find out that you are creating the right environment for you to excel in life. When you forgive yourself, you let go of weights in your life. Remember that the proof of love is in the ability to forgive and offer a second chance.

FURTHER STUDY: Mark 11:25; Hebrews 8:12; Daniel 9:19

PRAYER: Lord, please help me forgive myself for my errors so I can truly soar with wings like an eagle, in Jesus name, Amen.
