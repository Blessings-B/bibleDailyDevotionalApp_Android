The Most Excellent Way

'...And yet I will show you the most excellent way'. 1 Corinthians 12:31b
Text: 1 Corinthians 12:31, 13:1-3

The gifts of the Spirit are amazing. It is awesome to see miracles, hear prophecies, sit under inspiring Bible teachers and read about missionaries. We respect these things and so we should but Paul says that there is something more excellent. We may hear more about an anointed Bible teacher who can expound mysteries than we hear about a patient and kind bible teacher.

Paul says that without love, that great gift of prophecy, faith or teaching etc. is nothing.

PRAYER: Father, may I know and express your love always, in Jesus name, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: Express your gifting through love. Always.
