Bezalel

'...and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with
knowledge and with all kinds of skills...' Exodus 31:3
Text: Exodus 31:1-5

The Lord gives all kinds of gifts. Not everyone is an apostle, prophet or teacher and not everyone has the gift of healing or working miracles. Let us not assume that these are the only 'spiritual' and necessary gifts. Look at the example of Bezalel. God wanted a job done and so enabled a man to do it. Today, there are musicians, artisans, and accountants called by God to be so. They are neither greater nor lesser than the apostle or teacher. All are called to build up the body of Christ until we all reach maturity.

PRAYER: Lord, help me to discover and accept your gift and call on my life, wherever it is, in Jesus name, Amen. 

TIP OF THE DAY: Whether you work inside or outside the church building, we are all God's servants.
