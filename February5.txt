Sexual Purity

Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body,
but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. 1 Corinthians 6:18
Text: 1 Corinthians 6:18-20

In the culture of today, challenging yourself to remain pure in all areas is an excellent
goal. Sexual purity may be expressed by what you do with your body, but it is ultimately 
rooted in your mind, your heart and your soul. One of the lies that youths today believe is 
that Sexual purity is only about whether you have sex or not. We must understand that:
Jesus made it clear that sexual integrity is not just about the body but about what 
we feed our minds and senses with.
Engaging in sexually stimulating movies, websites, romance novels, and television 
shows is willingly giving Satan a piece of your mind and heart.
Pornography stimulates the brain storing lasting memories as if one is actually 
having sex.
The best news is that you can win this battle by purging your minds of the filth that 
permeates our media and environment and replacing it with the Word of God. Renew 
your mind daily with the Word of God.
Further Study: Matthew 5:27-30; Job 31:1; Romans 12:2
Prayer: Father, show me what it means to be holy and give me the courage to stand for 
the truth in this world, in Jesus name, Amen.
Tip of the day: Do not treat yourself like a trash can; you are worth much more.
