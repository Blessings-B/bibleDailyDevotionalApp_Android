Set an Example of Purity

Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young but set an
example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith,
and in purity. 1 Timothy 4:12
Text: 1 Timothy 4:11-12

Our text says we are not to allow anyone look down on us. This means that it doesn't matter what our friends, social media, that trendy television station or movie is saying. It is our responsibility to set examples for our friends and the world at large to follow. Always remember we are not living for ourselves. We are living for God who paid a high price that we might live. It is also important to remember that people are watching us. The scripture says we are living epistles. Do not be moved by that mockery or those words spoken in jest. There is dignity in standing out in purity. Some people are admiring you secretly and they will glorify God because of your life.

FURTHER STUDY: Titus 2:5; 2 Corinthians 3:2 

PRAYER: Lord Jesus grant me the grace to be an example for the world to see.
