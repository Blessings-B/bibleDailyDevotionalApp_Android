Purity: A Virtue for All Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God. Matthew 5:8
Text: Matthew 5:3-12

Purity is more than just saving sex for marriage; it is a way of life. Purity is the virtue of
generosity which makes us act without any trace of evil or selfish motives. Our intentions 
are pure only when they are free of self-interest, egoism, desire, envy, cruelty, spite, 
greed, malice, lust, trickery and dishonesty. Motives are pure only when they are free of 
power, control, and manipulation. Pure love is giving, not taking; it is a longing to see 
another happy as we sacrifice our own pleasure for their sake.
Purity is an important factor if we are to establish an intimate relationship with God 
because He is pure and wants us to be pure in speech, heart, body, and all areas of our 
life. This is the only way we can really and truly see God both here and after we are gone 
from this earth. Don't be bothered about being different, everyone admires someone who 
dares to be different, especially in a godly way.

Prayer: Dear heavenly Father, I want to be pure in every way like you. Please help me 
to be pure. Amen.
