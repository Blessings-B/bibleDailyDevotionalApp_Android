Purity of Heart - Guarding the Heart and the Mind

Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable-if anything is excellent or praiseworthy-think about such things. Philippians 4:8. Text: Philippians 4:6-8

We often hear the words "what is on your mind"? or "have a change of heart". Thoughts are seeds buried in the hearts and in the minds of every individual. It is important that when we think of a pure heart, we must think about it in line with scriptures. It is speaking about the heart of one whose sins have been forgiven and whose heart has been made new, whose purity comes not from their struggles but from the presence of Jesus in their lives. Jesus does not want us to struggle to do the right things. This can only be avoided when we ask Him to come into our hearts and help us in this race thus making us truly pure.
