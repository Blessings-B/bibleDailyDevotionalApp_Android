Purity of Speech-The Way to Win
Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. Ephesians 4:29.
Text: Ephesians 4:25-32

God spoke the world into being by the power of His words. Our words can build or destroy
the spirit of another causing violence, hatred, bitterness, timidity or joy, love, happiness 
or boldness. Have you ever seen friends who felt bitter towards a teacher or each other? 
Negative words such as "you are so dumb" or "can you not do anything well?" are usually 
the root of these negative feelings. 
One can be pressured to conform to the ways of the society in order not to be called a 
"Jew". They may begin to use vulgar and demeaning words or crack dirty jokes. Being 
pure and Christ-like means we do not use dirty or foul language. As Christians whose 
lives have been changed by the power of God, our words reflect that change. Our words 
are an outflow of our hearts, if we fill our hearts with the love of Christ, our words would 
be marked by truth and purity.
