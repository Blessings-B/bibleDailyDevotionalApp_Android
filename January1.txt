THE CREATION STORY
Every word of God is flawless; He is a shield to those who take refuge in him. 
Proverbs 30:5

Text: Genesis 1

What better place to start but at the very beginning. When we read the creation story, we see the Word of God in action. We see the power displayed through the Word of God. This should cause us to desire to know this Word. If it can introduce order to chaos, if it can give form to a formless thing, if it can bring into existence something that was lacking, if it can sustain a blessing, if it can bring companionship and fruitfulness and dominion, then it is worth your time.
When you look at your life and you do not see all you desire; when you want to bring a change but seem helpless to do so, when you want to put a stop to the works of the enemy in your life or in the life of your friend, the only place to look is in the direction of the Word of God. It is a goldmine that when searched out will transform any life or situation.
