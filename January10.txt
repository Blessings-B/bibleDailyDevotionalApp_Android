JANUARY 10th

What`s the Plan?
'All things are done according to God`s plan and decision...'
Ephesians 1:11a (GNB)

Text: Genesis 41
Every worthy outcome began with a plan. Plans are simply a series of steps to be carried out, geared towards achieving a goal. After Joseph, filled with wisdom from God, interpreted Pharaoh`s dream, he also advised that a wise man with insight be placed in charge of the country. This man was to gather up food in the years of plenty and store for the years of famine. This way the Egyptians would not have to suffer hunger. We don`t need any reminders that he got the job.
We see that a well-laid plan is the first step to mapping out a defined action. It also helps clarify our goals. Are we trying to become the best student in class? Having a study timetable is a good plan. Is our goal to own a business when we turn twenty? Then holiday internship is a good place to start. Remember the popular saying: The one, who fails to plan, plans to fail.

FURTHER STUDY: Ephesians 1:11-14; Proverbs 21:5
PRAYER: Thank you, Father for the spirit of wisdom like you gave Joseph to make plans and provide solutions, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Think of your goals. Draw a plan that will help achieve your goals in good time.
