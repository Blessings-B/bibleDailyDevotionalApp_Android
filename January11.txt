Priority First
 'Be very careful, then, how you live-not as unwise but as wise.'
Ephesians5: 15
Text: Ephesians 5:15-17

We`ve probably learned about a scale of preference in Economics class. It`s a list where we write our preferences in their order of importance. The basis of a scale of preference is founded on the limited availability of resources. Simply put, time is scarce.
On the average, we have twelve out of twenty-four hours to do something productive. How much time do we allot to different activities and what task do we handle first? A good exercise is to make a list of everything we need to get done, preferably the night before, by placing the most important activity first. It`s possible we won`t get everything done, but at the end of the day, we would have accomplished the important things. 
The end result of our little exercise will yield: less idle time; more work done; and best of all, satisfaction.

FURTHER STUDY: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8; Matthew 6:33
PRAYER: Teach me, Lord, to number my days that I may apply wisdom.
TIP OF THE DAY: Write a scale of preference for the next day`s task, apportioning time to each task.
