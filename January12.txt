Finding Balance
'...You are not doing it the right way. You will wear yourself out
and these people as well...' Exodus 18:17-18 (GNB)

Text: Exodus 18:13-27

Ever so often there are many activities competing for our attention- school and house chores; time for our family and friends; and time for us. It can get overwhelming when we have to deal with so much at a time.
However, we are not alone. Many years ago, Moses was faced with similar circumstances. He was leading the Israelites to Canaan, acting as the mouth-piece of God, and handling disputes. And Moses had the experience of age! When Jethro, his father-in-law, visited he saw what Moses had to deal with every day and advised him to appoint judges. By getting rid of the clutter, Moses was able to focus on more important assignments without wearing himself out.
We can take a leaf from Moses` book by asking for help when we feel overwhelmed. God, our ever-present help, is there as well as caring people He has surrounded us with who are available every day. We should not be ashamed to ask for assistance or too proud to take advice when it`s given.
