JANUARY 13th
Memory Banks
 'A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls.'
Proverbs 25:28 (ESV)

Text: Daniel 1:1-21

Studies show that it takes 21 days for a persistent activity to become a habit. Think about this: If we spend an hour each day going through school work, studying the bible or engaging in a physical fitness exercise, in roughly 2 weeks we`d have formed new productive habits.
Daniel and his friends could withstand the temptation of eating the King`s food because as young Hebrew men they had been trained to eat right and their regular meals had been tested and proven over time to work. Our muscles and minds are memory banks.  God created us a fully functional machine and our minds can be trained to perform tasks efficiently. But training our mind requires a huge dose of self-discipline and diligence to achieve desired results. Once we can get past the first few weeks, we`ll find doing our duties becomes effortless.
Always remember God has promised us help when we need it. By grace, we can do all things.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Corinthians 9:24-27; Jeremiah 35:6; 2 Timothy 1:7
PRAYER: Dear Lord, thank you for the grace to lead a disciplined life. By your strength, I have the power to form useful habits and shun idleness, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love and self-control.
