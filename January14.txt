JANUARY 14th
God Rested
 ...He said to them, 'Come with me to a quiet place and get some rest.' Mark 6:31b

Text: Genesis 2:1-4

After spending six days creating the world, on the seventh day God saw that all He had done was good, so He blessed that day and rested. God didn`t rest because he was tired, but because he understood how easy it is to get preoccupied with work and wanted to set a precedent for us.
When the Israelites were given the Ten Commandments, God set the Sabbath as a mandatory day of rest. In agriculture, we employ a system of rotational farming, by leaving land to lie fallow so they can rest and encourage the growth of good bacteria that help plant growth (Leviticus 25:4). All through the scriptures, God points us to the necessity of taking time off to be still. 
By taking time off, we allow ourselves the opportunity to review how much work has been done, what has been achieved, and like God, to see that it is good. The next day can be faced with a fresh perspective and a refreshed body.

PRAYER: Thank you, Father, for teaching me to take time off to rest. May I not in my rush to get things done forget that in your infinite wisdom you have ordained that man works for six days and rest on the seventh. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Resting is an important part of time management.
