JANUARY 15th
God`s Original Plan for Man
Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth and over all the creatures that move along the ground' Genesis 1:26

Text: Genesis 1:26-29

What is God`s original plan for me? It is said that the purpose of any product can only be defined by the producer. God has a strong reason for creating you; that is why in all creation, only man is made in God`s image and likeness. He thought and reasoned with the Trinity on how you and I will look to fit his intention. Everything about you (skin colour, height, smiles, etc.) is for a purpose.
He wants you to utilize all He has given you to be His ambassador on earth, serve Him and take charge of all that He created. You can see that God`s plan for man on earth is very great. He wants you to live as a god/king on earth (Psalms 82:6). Are you living as a slave rather than a king?

FURTHER STUDY: Genesis 1; Jeremiah 29:1; 2 Corinthians 3:18b
PRAYER: Father, forgive me and restore your original plan for me so that I can fulfill my purpose and be your true representative on earth, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Take a moment to evaluate if you are living as God`s representative here on earth.
