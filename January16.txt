JANUARY 16th
Man`s Separation from God
 'So, the Lord God banished man from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken' Genesis 3:23

Text: Genesis 3

In Eden, we see God`s ideal relationship and intimate friendship with us. God decorated Eden with everything that man needed to live a glorious life. However, after the fall (man`s disobedience), we lost that friendship with God and became separated from Him. The serpent deceived man with 3 destructive arrows stated in 1 John 2:16:
>Lust of eye - Eve saw that the fruit was good and pleasing to the eye.
>Lust of flesh - She wanted to gain wisdom and knowledge like God.
>Pride of life - She desired the most elevated position at all cost. 
The enemy is still using these arrows to destroy Christians today.
Are you battling with any of these arrows or perhaps, you have not accepted Jesus into your life? Here`s the good news - Christ came and died to reconcile you back to God so that the union, friendship, and intimacy can be restored.
Are you ready to surrender to Him now? Turn to page 8 and let us pray.

FURTHER STUDY: Genesis 2; John 1:29; 2 Corinthians 5:17-21
PRAYER: Dear Lord, I receive grace to live above every device of the enemy, nothing shall keep me from enjoying intimate friendship with you, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Write down practical choices you`d make today to keep you from the destructive arrows of the enemy.
