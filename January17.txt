JANUARY 17th
Abiding in God
'I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without me you can do nothing.' John 15:5 (NKJV)

Text: John 15:1-7

To abide simply means to live with, dwell or stay in a place. It also means acting in accordance with a rule/command. Abiding in God`s presence is the only way we can be fruitful (spiritual and physical) as Christians. Christ made it so clear to us that except we abide in Him and He in us, we can never bear any good fruit. Can a branch bear fruits on its own without getting nutrients from the tree? No. We need to access `nutrients` from God daily by spending quality time in His presence. This is done through prayers and the study of God`s Word.
What are the benefits of abiding in God?
>You will be fruitful and productive.
>You will not be cast away, thrown into fire and burned.
>Your joy will be full and complete.
>You will remain and grow in God`s love.
>God will give you whatever you ask in His name.
>The lust of the flesh dies. Etc.
