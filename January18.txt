JANUARY 18th
Pleasing the Master
 'And without faith, it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to
him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who
earnestly seek him'. Hebrews 11:6

Text: Hebrews 11:1-6

Faith is defined as being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. Having faith in God simply means to trust Him above all. This makes it clear why it is impossible to please God without faith. If we could please God without faith, it means we could please God without trusting Him. If after all God has done for mankind, someone does not trust that He exists then God cannot be pleased with such a person. In order to please God, we must trust that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek him.
Life is full of uncertainties, we often allow doubt, worry, fear and erroneous beliefs occupy the place that God should occupy in our lives. We must learn to put our trust in God and live a life of total dependence on Him - this is the only way we can please the master.
FURTHER STUDY: Hebrews 11; Romans 4:16-21; Habakkuk 2:4
PRAYER: Father help me to build my faith in you alone, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: God has a lot of things He wants to give you. Turn away from the obstacles that hinder you from trusting Him so the windows of heaven can be open to you.
