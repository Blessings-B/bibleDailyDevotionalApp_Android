Walking with God
'Enoch walked with God and he was no more, because God took him away.'
 Genesis 5:24

Text: 1 John 2:5-6

Walking with God is like the relationship between the shepherd and the sheep, where the sheep are expected to follow the shepherd `sheepishly`. As it is impossible to walk with someone and not arrive at the same destination, you cannot walk with God and your character will not reflect His.
Walking with God simply means to carefully follow all His commandments and to align ourselves with His ways/thoughts which are far higher than ours (Isaiah55:8-9). When we walk with God consistently, his nature rubs off on us, we get more transformed into His image and likeness, our flesh dies, gradually we stop conforming to the standards of the world and we start acting like Christ. 

FURTHER STUDY: Deuteronomy 28:1-14; Psalms 23; Romans 12:1-2
PRAYER: Father give me the grace to walk with you all the days of my life. I pray that I shall experience positive turn around in all areas of my life, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Choose to walk with God today in order for your purpose to find full expression here on earth.
