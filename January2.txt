Two Sharp Edges 
`For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword...` 
Hebrews 4:12a

Text: Hebrews 4:12-13

The word `alive` means currently existing or possessing importance. The word `active` can mean participating in a positive and lively way. These two words have been used to define the Word of God. In other words, the Bible which is the Word of God is not a dead piece of historical literature which may no longer be relevant in the world today.  The Word of God is relevant today.
The Word of God has also been described as sharper than any double-edged sword. The sword is sharp, active and alive. You can use it to cut off whatever is in your life that was not planted by God like a bad character. You can also use this powerful sword for any battles that you might be facing by speaking out the word of God over any struggles or battles you might have. You can pray the word of God so sometimes, instead of using your own words, use the word of God as your prayer.

PRAYER: Father I ask that you open the eyes of my heart to understand your word, in Jesus name, Amen.
