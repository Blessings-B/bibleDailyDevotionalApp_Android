JANUARY 20th
Vessel Unto Honour
'But in a great house, there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.'
2 Timothy 2:20 (KJV)
Text: 2 Timothy 2:20-21

As a young girl, I always thought to myself that vessels of gold and silver re the `superior vessels` and as such, vessels unto honour. However, a caloser look at the above text made it clear to me that the type of a vessel does not matter, what matters is the ability of the vessel to purge himself of dishonour, then it shall be unto honour, sanctified, and suitable for the master`s use.
For a cordial relationship to be established between you and God, you must resolve to become a vessel to be used by Him. The decision of what vessel to be is in your hands. You are the one that will consciously and deliberately abstain yourself from all forms of impurity. Your background does not matter, your source can be wood or earth and you`d still be used by God more than those whose sources are silver and gold. The question is - are you willing to purge yourself and surrender totally to Him?

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 15; Psalm 24:3-6; Colossians 3:1-17.
PRAYER: Father, I receive grace to purge myself daily and be a vessel unto honour ready to be used by the master.
TIP OF THE DAY: Say, 'I am righteous and sanctified, prepared for every good work'.
