Love, The Pathway
'Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love'
1 John 4:8
Text: 1 John 4:7-8, 20

Love is not just an attribute of God, it`s His very nature. It is only in Him that love can gain its full expression. Love is made perfect in Christ.
As followers of Christ, we are created in His image and after His likeness. Since God is love, it means that we also have that nature of love inherent in us. As a Christian saved and filled with God`s love, we must live in love towards God and one another for 'If anyone says, `I love God` yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen cannot love God, whom he has not seen.' (1 John 4:20).
Love is the true test of Christianity. The nature of God is rooted in love. We receive God`s love in our relationship with Him and we experience God`s love in our relationship with others. Remember God gave all for you, you can do the same for His sake. Your reward is surely in heaven and even here on earth.

PRAYER: Lord, please stir up the fruit of love in me, give me the grace to always walk in love.
TIP OF THE DAY: Your services to God will be a waste if you do not have love.
