JANUARY 22nd

The God of Purpose
For we are God`s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works,
which God prepared in advance for us to do.
Ephesians 2:10

Text: Psalms 139:13-16

God does not do things without a reason; He does not beat about the bush aimlessly. He thinks a thing through before embarking on it. If I were to ask you the purpose of some of God`s creations like the light, the waters, the birds and the flowers, you can easily tell. If these seemingly insignificant things have a purpose, then how much more the whole of creation. It is clear then to see that our God is a God of purpose. Everything He has made, He made to serve a purpose. Every step He requires you to take, He does for a good reason. 
Is it too much to imagine that since you were created in the image and likeness of God, there was a purpose for which you were created? There is something you are to achieve while on the planet earth. That something is the purpose for your life.

FURTHER STUDY: Genesis 1; Isaiah 43:6-7; 1 Corinthians 9:26
PRAYER: Lord, you created me for a good reason and I thank you because no more will I live aimlessly, in Jesus name, Amen.
