JANUARY 23rd

Where I Fit
'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you were born
I set you apart; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.'
Jeremiah 1:5
Text: Luke 4:19-22

Have you ever tried to work on a jigsaw puzzle to make everything fit as it should? It is not an easy task but if you were the designer, it would be a work over. We have already established that God is the designer of life and yours in particular. You were not just an after-thought even if you are one of those called a mistake by your parents.
If the world feels like a jigsaw puzzle and you need to know where you fit, go to the potter and ask. Be rest assured that He will point out where you fit and not only that, He will fit you there Himself and give you all you require to function effectively in your place.

FURTHER STUDY: Isaiah 64:8; Romans 9:20-21; 2 Peter 1:3-9 
PRAYER: Thank you Lord because I understand that I am not a misfit or a mistake. Give me the grace to function effectively in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: When you do not know what to do, check out the designer`s manual (Bible).
