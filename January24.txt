JANUARY 24th

Aligning to The Pattern
Therefore, I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not
fight like a man beating the air. 1 Corinthians 9:26

Text: Genesis 6:14-16

We had earlier established that there is a place you fit in God`s big plan. When God approached Noah to build an ark, He gave His specifications. If Noah had gone outside of it, he would have displeased God and the ark would not have survived the flood.
You need to understand that God has a pattern for you, because of His purpose for your life, which is important for you to follow. Do not live as if you have no destination/purpose. There is a pattern that the world introduces in every aspect of life. BE CAREFUL you do not fall into that pattern. Listen to Him and get His pattern (especially from the Bible) and align yourself to it so that all His good plans for your life will come to pass. 

FURTHER STUDY: Psalms 139:14-16; Jeremiah 29:11; 2 Kings 5:9-14 
PRAYER: Lord, it is a joy to know that you have my life all planned out. Help me discover your plans and grant me the grace to live it out, in Jesus Name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Read a chapter of the Bible a day because therein lies your pattern and of course your success.
