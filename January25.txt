JANUARY 25th

Courage to Achieve
Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you
so, take courage and do it. Ezra 10:4
Text: Jeremiah 29:11

God has just the perfect plan for you! He says His plans are good ones and He intends to give you your desired future. But there is a condition- you must be willing and obedient. I like the way the key verse puts it; you need to arise because the matter is in your hands.
God has the best plan, He has given you all you need to accomplish it but He would not move you into action. You have to move into action yourself; things remain at a stationary spot until force is applied. Be courageous because ahead of you lies a beautiful future.

FURTHER STUDY: 2 Timothy 1:7; Numbers 33:53; 1 Corinthians 16:13
PRAYER: Lord, you have given me all I need to achieve great things. Thank you for the gifts of the Holy Spirit, wisdom and grace for accomplishment, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Believe all God says and step out in faith.
