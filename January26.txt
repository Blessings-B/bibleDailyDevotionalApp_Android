JANUARY 26th

Seeing Well
Then the Lord said to me `You have seen correctly for I am watching to see
that my Word is fulfilled.' Jeremiah 1:12

Text: Daniel 5:5-17

Have you ever seen a blind man walking down a street? His steps are slow and unsure. Without the help of a guide, the man will grope about and encounter obstructions and not make any meaningful progress.
The King saw a writing on the wall but he could not really see it because it made no sense to him and would not determine his next step. The importance of seeing well, therefore, cannot be overemphasized. You can be put in slow motion and grasp at nothing in life. You could even get on the wrong path and not end at the good life God has planned for you. God is interested in you seeing clearly so He would know that His instructions for your life would be correctly carried out and His Word can be accomplished in your life. You can only see clearly when you take advantage of the Spirit of God in you and ``wash your eyes`` with the Word of God.
FURTHER STUDY: Isaiah 55:10-11; Acts 9:8-9, 22:11; Revelations 3:18

PRAYER: Lord, MAY understanding and clarity come to me as I study your Word so your purpose for my life can be accomplished, in Jesus Name, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: Always look at things from the spiritual point of view.
