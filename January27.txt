Speed Bumps to Fulfilling Purpose
I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race,
I have kept the faith. 2 Timothy 4:7

Text: Romans 8:35-39

Speed bumps, that is just what they are, bumps specially built to slow you down or reduce your speed. They are not meant to stop you; only delay your arriving at your destination. In fulfilling purpose, speed bumps can be introduced either by you, family and friends or the devil.
What is important is not who or what introduces it but your ability to recognize it and remove it, so you experience no hindrance in your pursuit of the good and abundant life God promised. Abundant? Yes, when you are able to accomplish God`s call or purpose in your life, which is the abundant life. Examples of speed bumps are trouble, hardship, anger, doubt, fear, procrastination, contention, ignorance, danger and so on. Nothing should deter us. Let us keep our eyes on the finish line.

FURTHER STUDY: Philippians 3:12-14; 1 Corinthians 16:9 
PRAYER: Lord, grant me the wisdom to spot speed bumps and grace to remove them out of my journey in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Rather than be stopped in your tracks, overcome that obstacle and keep your eyes on the finish line.
