JANUARY 28th

Balanced and Focused
And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature and in favour with God and man
Luke 2:52

Text: 1 Corinthians 9:24 - 27

This is one of my best scripture verses in the Bible. I could re-frame it to read ...and Jesus excelled mentally, physically, spiritually and socially. In as much as Jesus understood why He came, in as much as He was clear about His assignment on earth, He did not relegate these four (4) cardinal aspects to the background.
Paul also understood that and had his eyes on the price; arranging every part of his life to gain that price. This has to do with balance and focus. Imagine a four-legged chair sitting properly on the ground unlike when it has one or more legs missing. You need to carefully monitor your growth in the four mentioned areas to ensure balance. This would also add credence to your discovered purpose in life as well as hasten you to the finish line.

FURTHER STUDY: John 4:34; 1 Kings 20:37-40
PRAYER: Lord, if I am here and there, I will miss the mark. Grant me the wisdom to stay focused until I hear you say, `well done, good and faithful servant`, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Keep your eyes on the finish line.
