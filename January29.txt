The Gifts of The Spirit
`Now about the gifts of the Spirit, brothers and sisters, I do not want
you to be uninformed` 1 Corinthians 12:1

Text: 1 Corinthians 12:1-7


The gifts of the Spirit are so essential that no Christian should be ignorant of what they are and are supposed to do. However, we cannot fully discuss what each gift is here but there are two points that are really important to note today.
First, all the gifts irrespective of what they are, should point to the truth that `Jesus is Lord`. No one else is Lord and no one else should draw the attention to themselves through these gifts. Second, the gifts are for the good of all and not for any self-gratification.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Corinthians 12:1-28
PRAYER: Jesus, may I be careful to point all attention to you. Let my heart worship you alone. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Find and read a sound book on the gifts of the Spirit and all the Bible passages on this topic.
