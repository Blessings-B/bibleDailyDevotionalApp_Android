The Lit Path and the Portable Lamp 
`Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.` Psalm 119:105

Text: Psalm 119:99-106
Have you ever stood at a crossroad with seemingly identical and equally good paths before you? When you have to choose between two good options, life can become confusing. 
I have been at crossroads too. I used to worry that I would make the wrong decision that would cost me until I felt the Lord say to me `Never make a decision based on fear and/or guilt but faith and love.` Sometimes, it takes me a little while of prayer, research, and honest thinking to recognise where the faith and love path is. It is wonderful that God`s Word doesn`t only light our paths, it also lights specific steps for us, answering our questions. If you have ever carried a lamp to help light your way, you would know that you keep it really close so that you can see. You would also know that although the lamp might not light ten steps ahead, it lights your next steps. Therefore, we should search the scriptures for what it says on any issue or topic. 
FURTHER STUDY: 2 Peter 1:19; Zechariah 4:1-6; John 11:9-10

PRAYER: Lord, give me the courage to honestly seek your face through your word always, in Jesus name, Amen. 

TIP OF THE DAY: Wait for God`s light and learn to move by faith in His Word
