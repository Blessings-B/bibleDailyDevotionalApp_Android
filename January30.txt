JANUARY 30th

Eagerly Desire
 `Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit,
especially prophecy`. 1 Corinthians 14:1

Text: 1 Corinthians 12:31a

We are allowed and encouraged to want and crave for the gifts of the Spirit and to do so enthusiastically.  We should not stop at just wanting and craving. Let those desires for these gifts lead us to prayer. Ask God for them - whichever ones you want. He will then give to you according to His will.
When I was thirteen, I learnt that I could ask God for a gift of the Spirit. I really wanted one of them and so I asked God for it. I had also learnt that I should believe that I have received the gift and to begin to use it. So, I did. Soon after, people began to say to me, `it seems that you have this gift`. God used that to encourage me to carry on using the gift.

FURTHER STUDY: James 4:2; Matthew 7:9-11.
PRAYER: Thank you Lord that you give good gifts to us. We receive them by faith in Jesus name. 
TIP OF THE DAY: If you want the gift of the Spirit, ask for them. If you already have one, use it often for the good of others.
