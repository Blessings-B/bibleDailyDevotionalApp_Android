JANUARY 31st

According to Their Abilities
`Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve                         others, as faithful stewards of God`s grace in
its various forms.` 1 Peter 4:10
Text: Romans 12:6

In relation to our use of our gifts, God does not expect the same thing from all of us. He knows the abilities, grace, and type of gift He has given to each of us. Therefore, it would be futile to be looking at someone else and copying how they express their gift or to be puffed up at how we are using our gifts in comparison to someone else.
What is required of us is to use the gifts given to us according to the measure of grace we have. That grace could be more or less than the next person but it does not matter. It is a personal race and we will each answer to the Lord alone. 

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 25:14-30
PRAYER: Help me Lord to be a good steward of the gifts you have given me, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: In using your gift, focus on the Lord`s approval and not on the praise or criticism of people.
