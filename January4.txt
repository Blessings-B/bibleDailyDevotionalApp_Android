Hot as Fire
Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. John 17:17
Text: Jeremiah 23:29

The word of God is like fire as described in Jeremiah. When God uses synonyms, it is to give us a clearer understanding of what His Word is meant to do in our lives and situations. Think about all we can do with fire and all fire has the potential to accomplish; these are all indications of what His Word can and should do. A quick list is shown below:
>    It destroys; consumes; burns up anything not pleasing to Jesus.
>    It warms - comforts; protects/shields; lifts our spirit.
>   It cooks/prepares edibles - changes any life and makes it attractive and appealing.
>    It preserves/purifies - it cleans up our thoughts, words, and deeds.	
It is amazing how potent the Word of God in our hands is, only if we would take advantage of it. But you cannot take advantage of what you do not know. How much of the Word of God is in you?

FURTHER STUDY: Genesis 1:2; Psalms 119:133; Hebrews 12:25-29 

PRAYER: Lord, give me the grace to fill my mind with you by memorizing scriptures. 

TIP OF THE DAY: Apply the Word of God and let the fire in it do its work.
