Breaking Free
Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. John 8:32
Text: Jeremiah 23:29


Have you ever felt like your life was chained to a pole and your growth or movement restricted? There is hope for you today. The enemy moves about like a roaring lion looking for whom to destroy. He tries to steal, kill and destroy what God intends for us. We can only come in the name of Jesus and with His Word for that is where our victory lies. A hammer is a tool used to perform three major functions:
>It hits a nail on the head	-	it gives insight and clarity to issues.
>It puts things together	-	it can mend broken walls and families.
>It breaks through		-	it breaks down every high thing that exalts 
itself; hindrance; walls and challenges your thoughts, habits, and choices in life.
When you pick up your Bible, imagine that you have in your hands the tool you need to break through and push ahead in life. The journey may be a painful one, but it is a worthwhile one.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 John 2:24-27; 2 Corinthians 10:3-6; Jeremiah 1:9, 17-18  
PRAYER: Lord, I have realised that you want to do a great work in my life. I, therefore, submit myself to you to use your Word to chisel out everything that dishonours you.
TIP OF THE DAY: Persistently allow the Lord to speak to you about everything (not just the things you want to hear).
