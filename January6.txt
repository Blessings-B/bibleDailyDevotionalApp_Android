Water

`to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word.`
Ephesians 5:26

Text: Ephesians 5:25-27


Most people who have access to water would normally have showers or a bath every day. I know that there are people who would inconveniently travel lengths and breadths to fetch some water in order to have a bath. There are people who pay dearly for water to drink, wash, bathe and keep the environment clean. I don`t know anyone who does not drink water at all especially in very hot weather. Water is important, and we cannot do without it. It refreshes, quenches thirsts and cleanses. So does the word of God.
As the word of God has been described as water, we will need to:
>Read it every day in the same way we take a bath daily for cleansing.  
>Read it at least 2 - 3 times a day, as we would drink water lots of times to quench thirst.
>Read it constantly so you can flourish like the trees planted by the waters.

PRAYER: Father, I ask that you fill my heart, soul and being with a hunger and thirst for your word, in Jesus name, Amen. 

TIP OF THE DAY: It would be highly costly to neglect the scriptures. Whatever you do, make time every day to read the bible.
