JANUARY 7th

Seed
 `This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.` Luke 8:11

Text: Luke 8:4-15


I like the way the Lord has used the things we know to describe His Word. It makes it more relatable to us. The Word of God has been described as a hammer, fire, sword, light, lamp, water, and seed. Today, we will consider the Word of God as a seed.
From our text, the seed was not to blame for the different harvests produced. Seeds don`t grow by themselves. They need water, the right temperature, and location (soil). Therefore, they need to be planted (in the right soil) and tended (with water and the right temperature) in order to grow. God expects us to:
>Till the soil of our hearts to soften it through prayer. Pray before you read, asking the Holy Spirit to help you understand and see what He wants to show you.
>Plant the seed by reading it without distraction. Set aside times daily to read without interruption.
>Tend the seed by thinking about it. After reading, re-read and think about what you have read to get the revelation from it
>Then use the harvest produced to improve your life and that of others.
