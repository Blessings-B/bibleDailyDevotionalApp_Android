The Author of Time

" ... with the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day."
 2 Peter 3:8b
Text: 2 Peter 3:8

To manage time, it is important that we first understand the concept of time, how it came to be and God's view on time. In the beginning, God commanded, 'Let there be light' - and light appeared. This light He separated from darkness; He called the light, `Day` and the darkness `Night` (Genesis 1:3 GNB). And so there came about day and night as we know it, and over the centuries, the Roman calendar as is used today.
But unlike our perception of time, God is not limited by the boundaries of day or night. This points us to His supremacy and our total dependence on Him. He expects us, His children, to live our lives with eternity in our hearts, redeeming and making the best use of the time that is given to us, as we await His return.

PRAYER: Father, teach me to live out my days with the knowledge of the limited years I have, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Time is your most precious gift because you only have a set amount of it - Rick Warren.
