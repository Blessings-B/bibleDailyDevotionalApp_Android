The Time Thief
`Hard work will give you power; being lazy will make you a slave.`
Proverbs 12:24 (GNB)

Text: Proverbs 12:24

If I had a penny for every time I said, 'I will do this tomorrow' I`d be a millionaire today. For many, finding the right time to do what needs doing, and being disciplined to perform a task at the right time is a constant struggle. How often have we put off that house chore for later because our favourite program is on the television, or postponed homework because some friends came over?
Procrastination is the greatest time thief. It is putting off for tomorrow what can be done today.  Like a tiny voice in our head, procrastination tells us there is always some other time to deal with our duties when really there isn`t any time left. Our battle is about discipline-doing what needs doing even when we don`t feel like it. 
Can we manage that? Procrastination can make us slaves by encouraging laziness, stealing our integrity and peace; while discipline is the first step to getting things done. Remember, tomorrow never comes.

PRAYER: Dear Lord, give me the strength to overcome the temptation to leave for tomorrow what can be done today. I know that by your grace I am an overcomer, in Jesus name, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: Make this declaration:  Everything is permissible for me, but I will not be mastered by anything.
