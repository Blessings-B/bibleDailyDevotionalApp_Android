JULY 1st

Time for Everything
There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens.   Ecclesiastes 3:1

Text: 1 Chronicles 12:32

God is a God of order. He has ordained a time and season for everything and every activity. There is a time to be a baby; a time to be a toddler; a time to be a child; a time to be a teenager and a time to be an adult.
Wisdom is knowing the time you are in and the appropriate way to express yourself for every activity within your season of life. When a young person dresses like an adult, straining to look and act years older than their actual age, it is a sign that they do not understand their season.  
Enjoy each season of your life and make appropriate fashion choices for that season!  It will soon pass and you will have years in the next season.

PRAYER: Dear Lord, please help me to enjoy my days as a young person and make the best of my days, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Live life one day at a time and make each day count.
