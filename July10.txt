Spirit of Excellence: Joseph
Â When his master saw that the Lord was with him and that
 the Lord gave him success in everything he did,
Genesis 39:3

Text: Genesis 39:2-4

Joseph was another young man in the bible who had an excellent spirit. He stood out among all the servants in Potiphar`s house. We are called as light to be outstanding in all we do.
God is glorified when we are excellent and good students.  Our father is a God of excellence; therefore we cannot be anything less. We carry a supernatural nature as children of God hence we have no excuse.  We must attain heights never before attained. The sky is our starting point and the earth our oyster. Let us, therefore, arise because the earth is waiting for our manifestation as sons of God.
