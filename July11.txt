Need Help?

So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be disMAYed, for I am your God.
I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with
my righteous right hand. Isaiah 41:10

Text: Isaiah 41:10
Excellence in academics and indeed any other aspect of life is difficult. You will not always feel like studying, the topics and subjects MAY be difficult, in fact sometimes it MAY sound like Greek to you or seem like rocket science. But guess what? Our loving father has promised to help you.
Wow! Imagine being helped in that mathematics sum by the greatest mathematician of all times. God created everything so there is no subject or topic that He goes ``Oops, I don`t know this one.' Our Father is all knowing and all knowledge comes from Him. So, feel free to elicit His help anytime, any day. He is our ever-present help in times of need.

FURTHER STUDY: James 1:6; Psalm 46:1
PRAYER: Thank you, dear Lord Jesus, because I can always count on you to help me, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Always remember to call on God before every class or study period.
