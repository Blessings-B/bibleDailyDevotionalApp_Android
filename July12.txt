Ingredients for Excellence
Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings;
he shall not stand before mean men. Proverbs 22:29 (KJV)

Text: Proverbs 22:29

Diligence, consistency, and discipline are the major ingredients of excellence.  Let us define them:
>Diligence is careful and persistent work or effort.
>Consistency is acting or doing in the same way over time, especially so as to be accurate.
>Discipline is to train oneself to do something in a controlled and habitual way.
We, therefore, cannot do without these if we must excel academically. Excellent students are studious and hardworking. They are consistently studying and finding out new ways to gain knowledge, which is why the bible says such students (diligent ones) will stand before Kings. They are disciplined and do the right things at the right time. For instance, every good student should study for at least two hours every day.

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 12:24
PRAYER: Dear Lord Jesus, please help me to become a diligent student. Amen
TIP OF THE DAY: Write down ways you think you can improve your study habits.
