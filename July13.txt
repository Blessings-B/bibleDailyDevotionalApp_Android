Preparing for Exams

But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,
will teach you all things and will remind you of everything
I have said to you. John 14:26

Text: John 14:26

The word examination is one that gives the creeps to a lot of students, but for children of God that should not be the case. Our text today tells us that the Holy Spirit will teach us all things even the most difficult of subjects, so why fear exams?  Steps that can help us in preparations:
>Study like all depends on it.
>Start your revisions early.
>Form or join a study group because iron sharpens iron.
>Get good sleep and rest
>Pray and commit it all to God

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 2:6
PRAYER: Dear Holy Spirit, help me to remember always that you are able to teach me all things, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Write down other things you need to do while preparing for examinations.
