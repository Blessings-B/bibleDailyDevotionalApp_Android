Shortcuts?

There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end,  it leads to death.
Proverbs 14:12

Text: Proverbs 14:12

We live in a world today that is fast paced and seems to want everything to happen instantly. We are always looking to find shortcuts for everything. Well, the shocker is, there are no shortcuts to academic excellence. Children of God don`t engage in examination malpractices, writing exams in special centres, etc. God frowns at such acts. He wants us to study and use our brain. His grace is always available to us.
Even if every other person is doing the wrong thing, we should stand out for God. We should be the voice of reason. Let us activate the grace upon our life and show the world that success God`s way is possible and the best.

FURTHER STUDY: 2 Corinthians 12:9
PRAYER: Help me dear Lord to always do right by you especially in my academics, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: What other forms of academic wrongdoings have you seen in your school; what can you do to correct it?
