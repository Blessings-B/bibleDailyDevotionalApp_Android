Failure: Stepping Stone to Excellence

Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will rise.
Though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light.
Micah 7:8

Text: Micah 7:8

The story is told of Thomas Edison who invented the light bulb. He failed 10,000 times and when asked, `HOW DID IT FEEL TO FAIL 10,000 TIMES?' EDISON REPLIED, 'I HAVEN`T FAILED. I HAVE JUST FOUND 10,000 WAYS THAT WON`T WORK.'
In our academic pursuit towards excellence, there will be tests we will not ace or exams we MAY fail, but not to worry, failure is just a stepping stone to excellence. Do not be discouraged.  We must rise immediately, learn from our mistakes and move on. Here are some actions that will help:
>Study harder.
>Find out the reason you failed and what you can do differently.
>Do more research on the subject.
Ask questions.
>Always remember to invite the Holy Spirit to help you.

FURTHER STUDY: 2 Chronicles 15:7
PRAYER:  Help me, dear Lord, to always rise when I fall; to remember at all times that you are my light and help, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Write down other ways you can improve on your past failures.
