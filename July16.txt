JULY 16th

Let`s Talk about Sex
Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the Does of the field:                                   Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.                                                                                                                    Song of Solomon 2:7

Text: 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5

Sex is a gift from God, designed as part of the unique relationship of marriage. The Bible describes the pleasure that husbands find in marriage with these words: 'Rejoice with the wife of your youth... Let her breasts intoxicate you always (Proverbs 5:18-19). 
When we are talking about sex, we are talking about kissing, smooching, necking, romancing, whether fully clothed or not! Any of that outside marriage is wrong! The world would try and tell you `it doesn`t matter` but it does! If it didn`t the bible wouldn`t ask us to flee sexual immorality! As Christians and to keep from hurting ourselves, sexual desires and activities must be placed under Christ`s control.

FURTHER STUDY: I Corinthians 7:3, 4; Hebrews 13:4
PRAYER: Lord, I want to be pure in body and spirit, renew my mind daily and help me to flee when I need to, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Don`t go kissing and necking; arousing emotions that you are unprepared for.
