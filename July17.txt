It Is Not Good for Man to Be Alone (1)
'Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral'.  Hebrews 13:4

Text: Genesis 2:24

Sex is a unique, exclusive, and wonderful thing, a powerful bonding agent that shapes and affects the relationship between a man and a woman as nothing else can. That`s why God wants it reserved for marriage. To take it outside of marriage is like taking the wine consecrated for Holy Communion and using it for a party!
Sex in marriage is not just for recreation but also procreation. Thus, for a couple to engage in sex before marriage is doubly wrong-they are enjoying pleasures not intended for them and taking a chance of creating a human life outside of the family structure.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Corinthians 6:16; Mark 10:6-9
PRAYER: Lord help me to realize that I am accountable to you as it concerns my body, help me not to give in to the pressure to follow the crowd, in Jesus name I pray, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Opening up your body and mind to sex outside marriage invites a myriad of problems into your life.
