It Is Not Good for Man to Be Alone (2)
'Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So, she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother`s death'.                                                                       Genesis 24:67

Text: Ephesians 5:31

When God spoke of two people being joined as one, He was referring to something we`re only beginning to understand in a real, physiological way. When two people are intimate, the brain releases chemicals that induce feelings of attachment and trust.
Having sex outside of marriage results in forming an attachment to, and trusting someone with whom one does not have a committed relationship. TrustÂ becomes befuddled and misplaced. However, when it is part of the commitment and love in marriage, then it is safe to allow the intimacy that releases these chemicals. Sex outside of marriage creates bonds that tear apart people`s hearts instead of joining them together.

PRAYER: Holy Spirit my body is your temple, come and dwell within and keep me from anything that defiles, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Allowing anyone access to your body before marriage is allowing all the demons that person struggles with into your life!
