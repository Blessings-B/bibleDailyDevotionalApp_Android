Abstinence: Myth or Reality
'It is God`s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality                        1 Thessalonians 4: 3

Text: 1 Corinthians 7:8

The old testaments refer to unmarried women as virgins, no matter their age. Death was the penalty for not remaining a virgin while unmarried. People will say `that`s the Law, we are under grace` but was Paul who wrote the scripture above under Mosaic Law? Of course not! He`s saying, `you should abstain just like me`. If this were impossible, would Paul be advocating it?
Abstinence is God`s only policy when it comes to sex before marriage. It saves lives (protecting you from sexually transmitted diseases and from emotional and psychological stress), protects babies, gives sexual relations the proper value, and, most importantly, honors God.

PRAYER: Father, make me a sanctuary, pure, holy and true. Teach me to bring my body and emotions under subjection to the Word, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: It is possible to control your body and emotions; the bible says your will is subject to you. Control is key!
