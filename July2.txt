JULY 2nd

The Beautiful Swan
'I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew and developed and entered puberty. Your breasts had formed and your hair had grown,'                                                            Ezekiel 16:7

Text: Ezekiel 16:6-14

You know the story of the ugly duckling that became a beautiful swan? You know what really happened? I`ll tell you: It went through puberty! Like the young girl referred to in our text, the ugly duckling developed into a beautiful swan. This process of transforming growth which God takes us through is called Puberty.
Puberty is when adolescents reach sexual maturity and become capable of reproduction. In the coming week, we will discuss the myriad of changes that occur at this time. Till then, start this week with one thought: puberty and all that surrounds it is a natural process designed by God for our good!                                                                                                                                                

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 139:1-18 
PRAYER: Thank you, Father, for the care and love you invested in making me, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Walk with a bounce and a swing in your step, God made you beautiful.
