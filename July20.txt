JULY 20th

Lust versus Love
'How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?' And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refusedÂ to go to bed with her or even be with her.                                                Genesis 39:9-10

Text: Esther 2:2-4

In the past, women were viewed as sex objects, to be acquired for their beauty and disposed of when they have outlived their usefulness. Today, women are often still treated as objects of men`s lust.
We must learn not to be deceived by lust masquerading as love. Love is patient, love is kind, it does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth, it always protects (1 Corinthians 13). `He` says, `it`s okay to have sex if we love each other.` Please remind him that love is not self-seeking and while at that, remind him that love does not dishonor and pre-marital sex dishonors both you and your parents!

FURTHER STUDY: Galatians 5:19-24; 1 Corinthians 10:13; Daniel 1:8 
PRAYER: Lord give me the discernment I need in matters of the heart, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Pre-marital sex is trending, so are drugs, prostitution, and gangs! That something is fashionable does not make it right!
