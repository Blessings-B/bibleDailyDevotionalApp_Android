Fleeing Youthful Lusts
Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body.  1 Corinthians 6: 18

Text: Genesis 39:11-12

Joseph is a perfect example of what to do in the face of temptation. No tongue speaking, no binding, casting, just flee! Potiphar`s wife (a cougar) enticed Joseph 'day after day' (v. 10). That means she attempted to seduce him when he was weak as well as when he was strong.
Joseph had a choice, he could stay and justify himself by saying she initiated it, or flee. In our sex-saturated culture, lots of people feel pressured to be sexually active. However, the Bible consistently teaches self-control rather than self-gratification. So, flee from friends with questionable lifestyles; flee from places that promote casual sex; flee from television programs and music that arouse feelings that you are unprepared for! Just flee! 

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 15:19-20; Ephesians 5:3-5; Colossians 3:5-6
PRAYER: Dear Father, help to pick my friends carefully and to surround myself with people that would keep me on the straight and narrow path, in Jesus name, Amen
TIP OF THE DAY: Have an older Christian that you would be accountable to and run any `harmless` suggestions from `friends` off her.
