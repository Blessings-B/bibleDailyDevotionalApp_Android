But I Already Had Sex

'But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions-it is by grace you have been saved'                                            Ephesians 2:5

Text: Isaiah 1:18

Tamar had sex with her father-in-law and even had sons for him. Rahab? She was a prostitute!  Yet God forgave them! No matter the past, you can begin abstaining today. You MAY have struggled with sexual sin and you think, there`s no way out. I am here to tell you there is! I`ve been there, struggled with all manner of sexual sin, but here I am today, totally free and saved!
The first step is to ask God to help you. Next step is to open up to a matured Christian. Sin thrives when it is hidden. Step 3; End that relationship now! Remember the instruction to flee. God is neither anti-fun nor anti-sex, rather He is anti-pain! When we pursue anything outside of His guidelines, we will suffer consequences. 

FURTHER STUDY: Ephesians 1:7, 2:1-4; Psalms 32:1-11
PRAYER: Thank you, Father, for the blood of Jesus that speaks forgiveness, healing, and new beginnings, in Jesus name, Amen.
 TIP OF THE DAY: Take that needed step today.
