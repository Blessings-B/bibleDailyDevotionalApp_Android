Whose Perspective Matters?

But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not consider his appearance or his height, for
I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People
look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart'.
1 Samuel 16:7

Text: 1 Samuel 16: 1-12

There is a popular phrase that goes 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. This is an indication of how subjective comments on beauty can be.  When I buy a car, the car specifications as listed in the car manual would determine the value I place on the car and influence my perception of the car.
It is the same with beauty. For us to truly understand it, we need to consider it from the viewpoint of the Maker of beauty - God. Over the next few days, we will consider beauty through God`s eyes and understand how to develop and display true beauty, the kind which pleases the Lord. 

FURTHER STUDY: Genesis 1:31; Ecclesiastes 3:11; 2 Corinthians 5:16
PRAYER: Dear Lord, let me see beauty through Your eyes, let my thoughts align with Your thoughts, that my ways MAY align with Your ways, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Look beyond the external.
