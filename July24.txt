True Beauty

Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears
the LORD is to be praised. Proverb 31:30

Text: Proverbs 31:10-31

Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, a pioneer of the hospice care movement, said, 'People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within'. Your true beauty goes beyond what can be seen with the natural eyes. It is who you are on the inside. It stands the test of time and sets you apart.
Is there anything wrong with looking good externally? Absolutely not! However, God places greater importance on the development of His nature in me than how coordinated my makeup is. The fear (respect, reverence) of God in a young lady causes her to let God`s nature be displayed in her character and her personality. This happens through daily obedience to God`s Word. The more I do what He wants (as revealed in the Bible) and less of what I want (as demanded by my flesh), the more of His nature is revealed in me.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Peter 1:24-25; Matthew 23:27; 2 Corinthians 4:18
PRAYER: Dear Lord, help me to develop my inner beauty, my character under the tutelage of your Spirit, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Focus on God. He will mould your character and cause His nature to reflect in you.Â
