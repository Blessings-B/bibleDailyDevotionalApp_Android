Beauty Defined
'I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes.' 1 Timothy 2:9

Text: 1 Timothy 2:9-10

True beauty radiates from your inner self. It is the beauty of character which is far better sought after than mere physical beauty. 
You MAY ask ' where can this beauty be found?' It is found in God. True beauty is not defined by anything in this world but found in something that is beyond this world. It is God himself. God is beautiful, captivating, and fascinating.   Instead of looking at what the world calls beauty, look at the One who is beauty Himself. You are created in His image and likeness.  As you focus on His beauty as revealed in the Word, you grow to be as beautiful as He is. 

FURTHER STUDY: Genesis 1:31a; Psalm 139:14; Song of Solomon 4:7
PRAYER: Father, help me to daily understand the beauty you`ve made me and help me to live a beautiful life that gives glory to your name.
TIP OF THE DAY: Study the word of God to understand what true beauty is and how to live a beautiful life.
