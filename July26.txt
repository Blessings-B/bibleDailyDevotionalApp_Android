JULY 26th

Dress It Up Inside and Out

'Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God`s sight.' 1 Peter 3:4

Text: 1 Peter 3:3-6

It is very easy to focus on the external and forget the internal. As a daughter of the King, my standard of beauty is completely different.  Inside and out is important to God as we see in our key verse for today. The Bible refers to robes of righteousness and to garments of praise and salvation(Isaiah 61:3-10). This is what God wants us to be adorned with. These make us look beautiful in His sight and in the sight of others.
Fear and insecurity tell me that I need to add another layer of makeup, use more expensive accessories, and wear revealing clothing to be glamorous and fashionable and to measure up to the world`s standards. Focusing on the external alone makes me a temporary attraction. Wisdom means that I choose beauty that lasts.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Samuel 16:7; Isaiah 61:3-10
PRAYER: Dear Jesus, please dress me in the beauty of Your holiness. Help me not to rely on the temporary adorning that the world sees as attractive, but on the lasting beauty of a life yielded to You. Amen
TIP OF THE DAY: Work on your inner self and be confident
