Complete the Outfit

'When the Lord takes pleasure in anyone`s way, he causes their enemies
to make peace with them.' Proverbs 16:7

Text: Ephesians 6:10- 20

Today we are going to learn how to dress up in God`s recommended outfit for us! Start by covering your chest with righteousness. Righteousness is right positioning with God. For your ways to please God, it means you are in right standing/ positioning with Him.
Now cinch in that waist with the belt of truth, God`s truth as written in His Word! It is a lamp for our feet and it brightens our path, leading us to make the right decisions. A good belt pulls your entire outfit together and keeps it from falling. Add to that a priceless (paid for by blood) salvation beret! When salvation crowns your head, it affects your mindset and puts your priorities in divine order. 
But that`s not all! The sword of the Spirit and the shield of faith are fabulous accessories that make a power statement. Wrap yourself in the zeal for God as a cloak and you, my dear will be unstoppable. Now that`s an outfit!

FURTHER STUDY: Isaiah 52:7
PRAYER: Dear Jesus, let your glory rest on me and cause me to reflect Your beauty, as I walk obediently before you. Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Do not leave home without your God-recommended outfit!
