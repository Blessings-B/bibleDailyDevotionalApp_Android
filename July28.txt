How Beauty Is Perceived

Therefore, as God`s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
Colossians 3:12

Text: Colossians 3:12-14

To feel beautiful is to feel attractive based on attributes that we possess as individuals. The world`s definition of beauty is based on physical attributes, a wondrous combination of donated genes; accessories, fancy hairstyles, expensive jewelry, beautiful clothes with designer labels. However, all these no matter how good they seem are temporary.
True beauty is based on the virtues and values displayed by a person. It manifests in the character of a person.  1 Peter 3:4 declares that the beauty which comes from a gentle and quiet spirit is unfading.  Thus, an old man or woman with facial wrinkles, leathery skin and not very fresh breath can be called beautiful, because of the goodness that radiates from their spirits.

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 31; Proverbs 7
PRAYER: Dear Lord, help me to work on my inner man so that I will radiate your glory for all to see, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Let God`s word be your guide. It has amazing abilities to change ugly ducklings into beautiful swans.
