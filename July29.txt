Beauty of The God-Kind

'You are altogether beautiful, my darling; there is no flaw in you.'
Song of Solomon 4:7

Text: Song of Solomon 4:1-7

Do you sometimes struggle with feelings of inadequacy or inferiority? Do you look at yourself in the mirror and dislike your image, your size, the acne or freckles on your face, the hair that refuses to grow full and luxuriant? Do you dislike taking pictures of yourself because you think you do not fit the conventional definition of beauty? 
God says to you today 'Stop letting others manipulate your self-esteem by defining beauty by their standards!'.  He looks at you, clothed in your robe of righteousness, covered completely by the blood of Jesus and He says to you today 'You are altogether beautiful my darling daughter and there is no flaw (blemish, imperfection) in you'.  
Today, choose to believe Him. Put Him first and practice His Word even when it seems difficult. And soon, your beauty will be manifest for all to see.

FURTHER STUDY: Isaiah 55:8-9
PRAYER: Dear Father, thank You because You are the One who sees me. You truly see me as the beautiful young lady that I am. Let Your nature shine through me every day of my life and transform every life I meet, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Choose to believe God`s report about you.
