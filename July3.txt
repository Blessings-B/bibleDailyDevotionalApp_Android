What Is Going On?

 'For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother`s womb'.                                          Psalm 139:13

Text: Psalm. 139:13-16

Do you realize that what happens in your body during puberty was established when God formed you in your mother`s womb? Most girls start puberty between 9 and 11 years; some start at 12 or 13. At the right time, the pituitary gland produces hormones that begin to act on your ovaries. The ovaries respond by producing large amounts of several other hormones, including estrogen and progesterone.  
These 2 hormones along with a lot of others produced by the pituitary and other glands orchestrate the symphony known as puberty. And like a symphony, they not only have physical effects but emotional ones too. But don`t get worried, it is an interesting ride and usually worth all the effort.

FURTHER STUDY: Ephesians 2:10
PRAYER: Dear Lord, because every phase of my life is planned by you, help me trust you to guide me through puberty to adulthood, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Look at yourself in the mirror, smile and say, this is all part of God`s plan.
