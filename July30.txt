JULY 30th

Wake Me Up When September Ends

'Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, My Father, if it is possible, MAY this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.'
Matthew 26:39

Text: 2 Corinthians 12:8-9

Jesus, seeing the suffering that He would face and the separation He would experience by the death on the cross prayed for a reprieve. This is just like the reaction of any unmarried young person at the thought of pregnancy; a wish to wake up and find the whole thing was just a bad dream. The longing for things to be 'the way they were' MAY delay acknowledging the issue and seeking appropriate help for weeks or even months.
I know this because I too lived in denial for about 5 months and because my tummy `miraculously` was not showing, my mother did not know. I made a lot of mistakes because I had no one to guide me, mistakes I am here to make sure you do not make too. 

FURTHER STUDY: Jeremiah 29:11; Psalm 27; Isaiah 41:13
PRAYER: Lord I am scared! Help me!  But I know that You will never leave me nor forsake me and You will always be with me to help me.
TIP OF THE DAY: Talking to your baby eases the fear and reminds you that another human being depends on you.
