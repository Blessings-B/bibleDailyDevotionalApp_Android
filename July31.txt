Why Abortion Is Not an Option

'For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother`s womb.'
Psalm 139:13

Text: Psalm 139:13- 18

Every life (born and unborn) is precious to God, despite the circumstances surrounding their conception.  Abortion should not be an option, even where it is legally available. Pregnancy MAY not be a bed of roses, but your body will adapt and God will take care of you. Don`t try to cover it by opting for an abortion.  Talk to your parents or to someone you can trust who would tell them eventually.
 As grievous as it is to be pregnant out of wedlock, the situation is compounded if the act of abortion is committed. Realise that it is not a sin to be the child of an unmarried teen so your child has a good future under God who can make the most of any situation. He is gracious and He is a God who restores. So, trust Him for yourself and your baby.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 John 1:9; Ephesians 1:7; 1 Corinthians 6:19
PRAYER: Heavenly Father I know I brought this on myself, have mercy on me and help me not to sink further into sin by deciding to abort this precious life. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Talk to your parents or a mature Christian friend and do it fast before you give in to the temptation to abort.
