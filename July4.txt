Metamorphosis

The fig tree forms its early fruit; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance.                                            Arise, come, my darling; my beautiful one, come with me.'                                                                             Song of Solomon 2: 13a

Puberty is a time of blossoming. Under the effects of the hormone - estrogen, several physical changes begin to occur. The breasts begin to develop, hair begins to grow in the pubic region and the armpit, the hips begin to widen and of course menstruation and vaginal discharge occur. These are all normal.  They MAY seem messy and uncomfortable but there`s nothing to fear and you will adjust to all the changes in no time.
Another all too common occurrence in puberty is acne, also part of the body`s response to the large amount of hormones it`s being bombarded with. All these physical changes make it extremely important that you maintain good personal hygiene.
