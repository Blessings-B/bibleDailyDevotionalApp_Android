JULY 5th

Roller Coaster Emotions

He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock                               and gave me a firm place to stand.                                                                                                               Psalm 40: 2

Text: Psalm 40:1-5

A very wide range of emotions is often experienced daily during puberty. One moment you`re feeling that all is right with the world, your energy level is high, the world is sunny; the next moment you`re down in the dumps. The hormones released during puberty take a toll on our emotions. They MAY make you feel self-conscious and unsure.
Be encouraged through all the changes. Remember that you are a wonderful young lady, made in God`s image and worthy of His love and care. Depression MAY tug at you. Resist it! Let the sunshine of God`s love lift you out of any pit.

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 23
PRAYER: Heavenly Father, help me keep my eyes on the truth in your word in spite of my feelings, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Enjoy the roller coaster when it`s high and shake it off when it`s low. The lows do not last!
