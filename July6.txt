 We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.'                               Numbers 13: 33b

Text: Numbers 13:26-33

The 10 spies felt intimidated by the size of the Nephilim (giants). Note that the Nephilim did not say the spies were grasshoppers. The spies compared themselves to the giants and arrived at that conclusion. But Joshua and Caleb kept their eyes on the truth, which was that God was with them and therefore they were stronger than the opposition.
The process of puberty can make you feel awkward, clumsy, and unsure of yourself. But what you think of yourself should not depend on the changes going on in your body or around you. Keep your eyes on the truth of God`s Word. You are blessed, you are loved, you are cherished and you are beautiful!
