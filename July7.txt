JULY 7th

Social Bonding

Keep on loving one another as brothers and sister.                                                              Hebrews.13:1

Text: Hebrews 13:1-4

The desire for social inclusion, to be part of an intimate social circle is a strong human desire but it is often strongest at puberty. Unfortunately, this is often a time when young ladies can be cruel to each other.  As you seek to build friends and grow with them, don`t let this desire push you to the wrong group or type of friends.
Make friends who share your values and love for God. And when you see others who are excluded or bullied by the popular girls, reach out to them in love and compassion knowing you are representing your heavenly Father.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Peter 4:8-10; 1 Corinthians 15:33
PRAYER: Thank you, Father, for being there for me; you are a sure hope in every situation. Today I draw on your love, your hope as I walk out into a much-wounded world. Let me do as you would do in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Reach out to that girl who is at the edge of the social circles in your class today.
