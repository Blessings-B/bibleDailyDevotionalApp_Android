JULY 8th

Running with The Pack

'Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.'                               John 8:7b

Text: John 8:1-11

During adolescence, most girls move in cliques, having fun and growing together. Sometimes this can take a negative turn i.e. gossiping, exclusion and mocking others who are seen as `less cool`. The woman caught in adultery had clearly sinned and should have been stoned in line with the law. But Jesus did not condemn her.  He offered her kindness, compassion, and forgiveness.
There MAY be a girl who is overweight or shy or has a disability or speaks poor English. She MAY clearly be different. But, which of us is without an embarrassing secret? Which of us is perfect? Reach out in kindness today. Start a trend of compassion instead of cruelty. Dare to run against the pack.

FURTHER STUDY: Romans 12:1-2; Daniel 1:3-8; Psalms 34:13
PRAYER: Dear Lord, help me show kindness always; to boldly defend those who can`t defend themselves, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: If your friends badmouth someone, let them know it is an unkind thing to do.
