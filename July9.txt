JULY 9th

Spirit of Excellence: Daniel

Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps
by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him
over the whole kingdom. Daniel 6:3

Text: Daniel 6

The dictionary defines excellence as the quality of being outstanding or extremely good. The spirit of excellence was upon Daniel which made him stand out among his peers. He was extremely good in all he did especially in his studies, that he was elevated in the kingdom.
Today that same spirit is upon every child of God. All we need to activate it is simply prayer. God wants us to stand out amongst our peers so that His name will be glorified. He likes to be identified in our success. Like Daniel, let us strive at all times to be the best.

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 5:16
PRAYER: Dear Lord, please let the spirit of excellence rest upon me so that your name MAY be glorified through me, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Like Daniel, God has poured into us the spirit of excellence.
