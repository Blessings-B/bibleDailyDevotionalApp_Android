Contentment Versus Push
Whoever loves money never has money enough; whoever loves wealth is                                                     never satisfied with his income. Ecclesiastes 5:10

Text: 1 Timothy 6:6-11

I recall my desire to get to the next class while a student. It was like that would be my ultimate but to my disMAY, each time I made it to the next class, I got bored quickly and wanted to get to the very next one. It made me realise that we can never really be satisfied or content with our attainments except by the help of God. Our main text states that godliness requires an attitude to be highly profitable. The scriptures implore us to pursue more important and durable riches because money is fleeting.
There is a thin line between desiring more of God`s monetary blessing and greed - the desire to acquire more for selfish reasons. You need to clearly watch your motive, which is an indicator of when you have crossed that line. 

FURTHER STUDY: Ecclesiastes 1:5-10; Matthew 6:19-21, 24-33; Hebrews 13:5
PRAYER: Lord only you can help me not to tilt over to lack of contentment when all I really desire is more of your blessing. Please keep me on track in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Always ask yourself ``why do I want what I want?``
