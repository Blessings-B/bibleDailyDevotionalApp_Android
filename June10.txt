Staying True
 '...he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them....'                                                           Genesis 42:7

Text: Genesis 42:1-20

Someone upset me at work and for a while, I kept imagining how best to get even. Thankfully, I remembered whose I was and how He would expect me to behave in that situation. Consider an ant that collides with a misplaced stick in its path. It can choose to climb over the stick and continue on its path, stronger than before or go around the stick, off the path.
Joseph was like that ant. He was initially tempted to seek revenge, an action that would take him off his destined path. However, he remembered that God had been with him and he chose to carry on with God as he had always done. God will always be there for us even though we might not think so.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Corinthians 10:5-13; 2 Timothy 1:10-12
PRAYER: Father, help me never to lose sight of my identity in the midst of life`s struggles, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: No matter the situation, always stay true to the nature of Christ in you.
