My Utmost Desire
`Whom have I in heaven but you? I desire you more than anything on earth`.
Psalm 73:25 (NLT)

Text: Psalm 73:25-26

Certain things require serious attention in life and desire is one of them. It is a longing or craving for something that brings satisfaction or enjoyment. An addict MAY easily be identified by a deep craving that must be addressed quickly anytime it hits them.
From the passage above, David acknowledged that God is his ultimate desire and that he earnestly desires Him above any other thing. His priority in life was to know the Lord, seek and search Him out diligently. No wonder he was called a man after God`s heart. 
Anyone who seeks the Lord persistently finds Him. Unfortunately, we have allowed mundane things to becloud and occupy us. We channel our desires wrongly and the effect is usually disastrous. Any desire that does not draw you closer to God should be discarded with urgency. Don`t let that momentary `enjoyment` destroy your future. There is a God spot in you which can only be filled by Him.
