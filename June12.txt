The Diligent Rule
`Be lazy and become a slave` Proverbs 12: 24b (NLT)
Text: Proverbs 12: 24

If there is one thing that makes success more attainable, it is diligence. Diligence is a constant and earnest effort to accomplish a task. For some students, studying hard and burning the midnight candle is an insurmountable task. Some of these students would prefer to cheat, procrastinate and be lazy. Unfortunately for them, diligence is the one attitude which we need to excel in life spiritually, financially, in education and otherwise.
Examples abound in different fields, like the founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Dangote. The same principle applies too to those who wish to seek God fervently. These diligent God-seekers are not devoid of insight or wisdom rather they are beams that shines forth the light for others. With hard work and excellence, elevation is inevitable!

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 10:4-5; Romans 12:11
PRAYER: Father, remove slothfulness from my life so that I will be useful to you and humanity, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Diligence breeds success. Pursue it!
