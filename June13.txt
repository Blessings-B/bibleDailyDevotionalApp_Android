Don`t Be a Lazybone

`Learn from their ways and become wise.` Proverbs 6:6b (NLT)

Text: Proverbs 6:6

There are few things that hinder success like slothfulness, excuses, and procrastination. These are avoided by successful people. 
A good illustration is that of a certain man who became physically challenged as a child as a result of Polio. He was taunted and mocked; rejected and isolated but in the midst of rejection, he discovered himself, became his own friend and vowed to make a mark on earth. He decided to set goals for himself and pursued it with all vigor. Along the line, he found Christ and his life turned around. Today, he has attained an eminent position in a Nigerian University and is highly sought after as a motivational speaker. 
In all areas of our lives, we need to set achievable goals and put in some effort to actualize those goals.  We must also not neglect our need for intimacy with God. We must set aside some time to study the Bible, pray and fellowship with others.  Yes, people excel in life even as unbelievers but you have an edge over them with God by your side. 

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 90:12; Romans 12:2-12
PRAYER: Father, saturate me with the wisdom that comes from above that I MAY excel above my peers, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Pursue your dream passionately and nothing will stop you with God on your side.
