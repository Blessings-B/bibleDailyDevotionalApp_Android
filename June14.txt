The Battle for Your Soul
`Let the Holy Spirit guide your lives.` Galatians 5: 16a (NLT)

Text: Galatians 5:16

Life is a battle and it is the battle for the soul. The flesh and the spirit are always at war and the one you yield to controls you. 
A boy in my neighborhood kept feeding his mind with all sorts of junk - provocative videos, arousing music and immoral pictures. To cut a long story short, before long, he decided to practice what he had been learning. The result was an unwanted pregnancy of a girl and a lot of heartache and pain. 
Our consistent ability to say no to deadly appetites that confront us daily will distinguish us as people of God. Self-control, a fruit of the spirit simply means control over self.  We are enjoined to meditate on the word of God day and night to enable us to triumph and to hide the word of God in our hearts so that we will not go astray. The challenges of this age are quite enormous and should be confronted headlong with the wisdom and knowledge that comes from the presence of God. Sexual immorality is very destructive. Free your mind from such garbage. 

FURTHER STUDY: Galatians 5:16-24; Romans 6:6
PRAYER:  Cause me to hide your word in my heart oh Lord, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Refuse to be a victim of this world`s pollution.
