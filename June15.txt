What Is Your Label?
`For anger labels you a fool.` Ecclesiastes 7: 9b (NLT)

Text - Ecclesiastes 7:9

I had the opportunity to visit a remand home and heard some shocking stories concerning the inmates. These are children below 18 years who were remanded as a result of various vices. Some of them ended up there because they had killed somebody whilst fighting. Their story was that they had no initial intent to kill anybody but having been overtaken by anger, they ended up being murderers! Anger is such a powerful emotion!
Whatever comes your way, note that you are responsible for your reaction and not for the way you are treated. Anger is the work of the flesh and should be dealt with severely. Self-control is a fruit of the Spirit and God is happy when such fruit abounds in us. Don`t be a fool. When you are confronted with situations that could result in outbursts of anger, cry out to God for help, restrain yourself and keep calm; then and walk away from the scene. 
Impulsive actions always lead to regret, avoid them! The righteousness that God desires from us can never be produced through anger. 

FURTHER STUDY: James 1:19-20; Colossians 3:8
PRAYER: Help me Lord to be quick to hear and slow to anger in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Resolve to be calm no matter what confronts you today.
