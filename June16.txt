Bowels of Kindness
 'You must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted mercy, kindness.'
 Colossians 3:12b (NLT)

Text - Colossians 3:12

Children often emulate their parents and as God`s children, we are meant to take after Him. Kindness is one of the attributes of God. It is a part of the fruit of the Spirit that showcases us as God`s own. It means to care about someone, to be useful and helpful to others; to be generous, compassionate and hospitable.
We have been chosen by God to reflect His image through the way we relate to people. According to the passage, we are to wear kindness as a cloth, which means everything about us should speak kindness. Just as a sane person cannot step out of the house without covering his body, in the same way, we are enjoined to dress ourselves up with kindness. 
What are we known for? The story of Dorcas in the Bible readily comes to mind. She was incredibly kind to people such that when she died, people wailed and cried and could not imagine her dead and she was brought back to life. Kindness makes you attractive!
