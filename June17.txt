A Smile Is Infectious
 `Don`t look out only for your own interest.` Philippians 2:4a (NLT)

Text - Philippians 2:4

Everyone you meet in life is fighting a hard battle and something as simple as a smile might give them the courage to conquer their battle. One universal language of kindness is a warm smile and even babies know how to speak this. Putting a smile on someone`s face ignites love. Compliments like, `You are so beautiful; I love the way you laugh; that dress fits you etc.`, does amazing things to others.
You can also put a smile on someone`s face by lending a helping hand to those in need of help, for example, volunteering to babysit for that mummy who needs it; visiting somebody in the hospital; washing somebody`s clothes; giving up your seat for an older person.  These are pockets of kindness that please God and do not go unrewarded. 
Come to think of it, God is always putting smiles on our faces. He is so mindful of us in every way. His hands are wide open reaching out to us and working for our good. 
The world knows enough hell; let`s show them a little more heaven (Anonymous)
