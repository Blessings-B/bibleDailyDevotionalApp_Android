Who Is a Mentor?
Having such deep affection for you we were delighted to share with you                                                 not only God`s good news, but also our own very lives because you
had become so very dear to us. 1 Thessalonians 2:8 (AMP)

Text: 1 Thessalonians. 2:6-12

Growing up, the concept of a mentor was that of a tall, domineering, old man in long white robes, reciting ancient proverbs to me, in the hope that these would straighten me out. Fast forward a few years. I had an actual experience being mentored by an aunt and to my greatest surprise, she was actually fun to be with. Visiting her home, watching how she lived and ran her business while keeping a healthy relationship with her family and friends helped to shape a lot of my present beliefs.
A mentor is one who guides a less experienced person, by building trust and modeling positive behavior. Such a person`s love for God directs him or her to teach others to love God and to surrender to his will and watch him transform their lives daily. 

FURTHER STUDY: Galatians 5:23-24
PRAYER: Heavenly Father, thank you for giving me the Holy Spirit to be a friend and teacher. Help me to find the right role models and mentors who will help bring out the best in me, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Thank God for those who have positively influenced your life so far.
