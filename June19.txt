What`s the Point in Having a Mentor?

And you shall teach them the statutes and the laws and show them                                                   the way in which they must walk and the work they must do.                                                                                                                    Exodus 18:20 (KJV)

As a superhero movie buff, I quite enjoy watching behind the scenes clips of my favorite movies. It makes me feel like I`m part of something huge. The actors seem more real and less perfect, just like me.
Having a mentor gives you this rich dose of reality 24\7. You get a sneak peek into their lives, to see the good, the bad and the ugly. Their past and present experiences are used to guide you through the many pitfalls of life.
Our text shows Moses mentored by Jethro, his father in law. His wise advice when obeyed saved Moses from looking like an ineffective leader to his people. It showed him a much better and easier way to do things. This is why mentors are a blessing.
