Wisdom for Multiplication
The Lord shall increase you more and more, you and your children
 Psalms 115:14(KJV)

Text: Genesis 26:1-2, 12-22

The key verse speaks the mind of God concerning us. He wants us to increase in every aspect and this desire or promise extends to our generation. In our text, we find that despite the famine in the land, Isaac increased and multiplied in land, cattle, crops, and servants. He had what people would term `multiple streams of income` and this was honestly gained. If God desires for all His children to prosper and increase, why is it not happening? All God`s promises are conditional. The principles Isaac applied to get to this point in his life are clear:
>Isaac sought God`s direction in the place of prayer.
>He obeyed even though it did not make logical, common or professional sense.
>He chose to start small.
>He was hardworking and not a waster.
>He did not engage in fights and quarrels.
>He kept a tight connection with God and His Word.
In summary, we cannot multiply without the Word of God for in it we have life in its fullness.
