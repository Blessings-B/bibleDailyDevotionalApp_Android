How Do I Pick a Mentor?
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.                                                                                                2 Timothy 2:2

Text: 2 Timothy 2:1-7

In some cases, a mentor finds you and in others, it`s you who goes searching. The first thing to do when searching is to pray. Ask the one who knows you better than you know yourself to show you the best mentors for you. It is important to do this because we often do not see the struggles of those whom we look up to. It`s not everyone with a fairytale life that is a candidate to mentor you.
Mentors come in different ages, gender, and nationalities. One`s spiritual mentor MAY not be their career mentor. Paul, if he lived in these days, would have been the kind of guy who graduates from Harvard law at the top of his class. He was super smart. Paul picked Timothy and was his spiritual and ministry mentor. Till this day, the techniques that Timothy learnt about running the ministry, are still used to run many multinational organizations and churches.

PRAYER: Dear Lord, help me in my decision making to put you first. You know me better than I know myself and you alone know what is best for me. I ask this in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Prepare yourself to be someone worth mentoring.
