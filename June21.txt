What Should I Expect as A Mentee?
My son attend to my words, listen closely to my sayings, let them not depart from thine eyes. Keep them in the midst of thine heart.                                                                                                                         Proverbs 4:20 (KJV)

Text: Proverbs 4:20-27

A mentee is someone who is being trained by a mentor so the relationship goes two ways. It is a give and take relationship. Which means your mentor MAY be the recurrent giver but you are also expected to give back. Picture this: you wake up, browse for 3 hours, play games then chat on WhatsApp with school friends, then grandma calls to tell you she has discovered imo video chat and she keeps you on a call for 1 hour ... the next notification you get is a low battery warning. It`s time to either stop to recharge or lose out on all the fun you are having. Mentors are natural givers and this trait qualifies them to serve you, but they too are flesh and blood and they need to recharge. 
The greatest reward or recharge you can give back to your mentor is to succeed at what they have taught you. So be sure to give time and effort to tasks given to you by your mentor and give feedback.

FURTHER STUDY: Acts 16:1-5; Acts 25:36-39.
PRAYER: Jesus, keep me humble.
TIP OF THE DAY: Take notes when being taught and make your own footnotes too. This helps when you need to make reference.
