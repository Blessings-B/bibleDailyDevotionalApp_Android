Can I Also Be a Mentor?
Let your light so shine before men that they MAY see your good works and glorify your father in heaven. Matthew 5:16 (NKJV)

Text: Matthew 5:13-16

We mentor our siblings every day without even knowing it. Living by example is the simplified meaning of mentorship. So when your baby sister begins to talk like you and tends to pick out the same style of clothes you like to wear, it`s all a byproduct of your unconscious mentoring.
This should make you reflect on what exactly you are modeling for your family and friends and the whole world to see. What is your daily routine? Do you make a habit of greeting? Do you spend some time praying? Do you litter? Do you study and share the word of God with your friends or do you act ashamed of Jesus? 
Think about this ... 'if what I do can either make someone fall into sinful living or make them live to please God, have I done a good job so far?' If the answer is NO, then it`s time to reset.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Timothy 4:12; 1 Corinthians 11:1
PRAYER: Dear Lord, help me to glorify you in my thoughts, words, and actions in Jesus name, Amen.   
TIP OF THE DAY: Pause and ask yourself WWJD? What Would Jesus Do?
