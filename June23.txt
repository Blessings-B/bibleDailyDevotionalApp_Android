Age Doesn`t Always Mean Wisdom

Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he shall lift you up.                                                 James 4:10 (KJV)
Text: James 4:7-10

We talked earlier about the fact that mentors can come from various walks of life. Today we discuss age and wisdom in relation to mentoring. As the topic states 'Age does not always mean wisdom'. Your mentor MAY sport some grey hairs or they MAY still be in elementary school while you are in high school. We select mentors based on their level of expertise in the areas where we are less capable and need assisted growth.
A 10-year-old musical prodigy could make an excellent mentor to a 19-year-old music student. I for one would like Chef Ramsey (master chef junior) to send one of his junior chefs to mentor me. They definitely cook and understand food better than I do. Whoever mentors you or whoever you get to mentor, always remember to be humble so you can be lifted higher.

FURTHER STUDY: Job 33
PRAYER: Father your word says that you resist the proud and give grace to the humble. I drop every trace of pride today and receive your grace Lord in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: To know what things you enjoy doing, try out new things when the opportunity arises.
