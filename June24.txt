JUNE 24th

Just Do It
Lord remind me of how brief my time on earth will be, remind me that my days are numbered how fleeting my life is. You have made my life no longer than the width of my hand. My entire lifetime is just a moment to you. At best each of us is but a breath.                         Psalm 39:4-5 (NLT)

Text: Psalm 39:1-5

Laziness is one of the things that mentorship helps us to conquer. If we stand alone we could procrastinate. We end up pushing what should be done today into tomorrow and the next day. 2 years later it`s still not done. A good mentor gives you attainable tasks and deadlines so that you develop the right sense of urgency needed to complete projects and assignments.
Procrastination is not the same as Patience; it`s the direct enemy of progress. Completing tasks, sitting with your mentor to review and evaluate them is a sure way to measure your progress and develop the strength of character that is required to lead or succeed. 

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Samuel 9; Acts 4:36-37
PRAYER: Thank you, Jesus, for coming that I MAY have life more abundantly. Help me to live out that abundant life that you have blessed me with, in Jesus name, Amen.  
TIP OF THE DAY: Don`t take the back seat in life. Life is short like Nike says 'JUST DO IT'. Bake a cake or fly a kite, so long as it glorifies the Father in heaven.
