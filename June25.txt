Fashion- A Lifestyle

 'but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God'.
1 Timothy 2:9-10

Text: 1 Timothy 2:9-10

Fashion! One word used to capture a prevailing style of clothing, hairstyle, decoration, appearance, and way of behaviour. It is a strong non-verbal means of communication because your fashion style tells a story (intentional or not) about your personality, to the people around you. 
There is a popular saying 'dress the way you want to be addressed'. Our choices regarding our appearance and behaviour should be influenced by the Word of God. The choices we make can provide avenues to interact with people around us; to enlighten them as to our identity in God and the influence behind our fashion style. Let godliness be your LIFESTYLE and the LANGUAGE of your fashion choices.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Peter 3:3-4; John 17:16
PRAYER: Lord, please let my choices reflect my identity in You, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Let your fashion style give you access to evangelise.
