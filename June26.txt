Clothed in Love

 'And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the
Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him'.
 Colossians 3:17

Text: Colossians 3: 1-17

Ever heard the phrase 'dressed to kill'? It means to wear glamorous clothes intended to create a striking impression or to attract attention and admiration, especially of the opposite sex. 
When choosing what to adorn yourself with, ask the following questions: does this please God? Does it cover body parts which are meant to be hidden? Does it ensure that I am addressed respectfully? Will it bring disrespect to my Father, the King? Will my clothing attract undue attention to myself? The answer to those questions should determine what you wear.
In 1 Corinthians 16:14, we are urged to do everything in love. If what I wear will cause someone else to sin in their hearts, then love demands that I do not wear it.  Our Father the King would rather have us clothed in love than dressed to kill. So, ask the Holy Spirit to help you choose your clothes and adornments. He has been my personal stylist and He gets it right first time, all the time!

PRAYER: Dear Lord, help me to adorn myself in a way that pleases you and reflects your love, in Jesus name, Amen.
