The Style of A Princess

But you are a chosen people, A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD, a holy nation, God`s special possession, that you MAY declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness
into his wonderful light. 1 Peter 2:9

Text: 1 Peter 2:4-9

As a child, I was always fascinated by the way princesses dressed. They looked so elegant, modest and beautifully dressed.  I often wished I was royalty.  After I accepted Jesus as my Lord, I learnt that in Christ Jesus, I am royalty!  This royalty is greater and higher than that of the ladies of this world because your Father is God, the King of Kings.
My awareness of my royal heritage inspires my fashion choices not the popular trend of the day. My aim is to be elegant and stylish, without unduly exposing anything which should be hidden. My dressing should turn heads but not break necks!

FURTHER STUDY: Esther 5:1
PRAYER: My Father and my King, help me to always remember that I am your princess and to reflect that in my dressing, adornment, and behaviour.
TIP OF THE DAY: Dress to please the King.
