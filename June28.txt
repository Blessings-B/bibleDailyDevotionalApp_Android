JUNE 28th

My Father Is A Fashion Guru

'They shall also make the ephod of gold, of blue and purple and scarlet
material and fine twisted linen, the work of the skilful workman.'
Exodus 28:6

Text: Exodus 28:1-10

Our heavenly Father is creative and loves beauty. We can see this creativity in the level of attention and detail that He put into creating the beautiful world we live in. When the Israelites built a tabernacle to God in the wilderness, God provided detailed descriptions of how the tabernacle should be built, decorated, even down to a detailed description of the clothing to be worn by the priests!
You don`t have to be a fashion expert to know how to dress, combine clothes, accessories, and hairstyles for various occasions.  You are a child of God and you have the creativity your Daddy has. As a chip off the old block, you see the way God sees. Ephesians 2:10 says' For we are God`s MASTERPIECE (a work of outstanding artistry, skill, or workmanship). He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago'. When you remember that you are God`s masterpiece - a work of outstanding artistry, your fashion sense kicks in; you scrub up and dress up!

FURTHER STUDY: Ephesians 2:10; Psalm 139:14
PRAYER: Dear Father, please guide my fashion choices today, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Ask your fashion guru- your Father God.
