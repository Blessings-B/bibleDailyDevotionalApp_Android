Is It Right for Me?

'I have the right to do anything,' you say-but not everything is beneficial.
Â 'I have the right to do anything'-but not everything is constructive.
1 Corinthians 10:23

Text: 1 Corinthians 10:23-33

Your fashion statement as an individual is a combination of your jewellery, clothes, accessories, and hair. It should suit you as a person and should suit the occasion. You have the right to pick any fashion style you want.
However, as a daughter of the King of kings, I ask myself several questions when putting together a fashion style: does this choice present me in the best light, as a representative of the King? Does it give a true picture of who I am? Does my total outlook create a lovely effect (complimenting colours and accessories) which is pleasing to the eye and gives God praise? Or do my choices have a jarring effect on the eye with colors clashing, causing people who see me to cringe?  

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 5:16; Philippians 4:12
PRAYER: Dear Lord, thank You for the gift of Your Holy Spirit. Please help me make the right fashion choices that bring You glory, in Jesus name.  Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Pick complementing colours.
