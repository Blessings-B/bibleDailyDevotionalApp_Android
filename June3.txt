Rendering Account
Nothing in all creation is hidden from God`s sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
Hebrews 4:13

Text: Matthew 25:19-30

If you understand that you have been given charge over money that is NOT REALLY YOURS, then it would not be strange or difficult to be told to give an account of how it was disbursed and put to use. It would be a great error to go to market without making a list; you will either buy some things you will regret later or spend more than you would have liked to. Anyone who has been handed over a business should be prepared to render account. That understanding introduces caution in the way we handle what has been freely given to us because nothing can escape His eyes.
We are going to face a just judge who would check our motives, our obedience level, our love, our integrity in handling what was committed into our hands, how aligned we are to His instructions amongst other things. Our just judge does not expect us to operate beyond the grace given unto us neither does He expect us to operate below that capacity. 

FURTHER STUDY: 2 Kings 22:4-7; 2 Kings 12:13-16; Ecclesiastes 9:10
PRAYER: Lord, I shall give an account of what I did on earth which includes finances, I want you to be able to say `well done, good and faithful servant` in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Be worthy of trust; be faithful with money.
