Dressing 101

If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you. James 1:5

Text: James 1:1-5

Putting together an excellent and godly outfit requires much wisdom. Thank God that He promises to give us wisdom if we ask! 10 key points to remember are:
>Dress the way you wish to be addressed. First impressions are important.  
>Dress in a neat and tidy manner.  
>Dress for the occasion. You do not wear a trouser suit to the beach.  Every occasion has an appropriate dress code.
>Dress for your body type and use accessories like belts, scarves etc. to enhance your dressing.
>Undergarments are meant to be under our clothing. Avoid exposing them. 
>White or light-coloured undergarments should not be worn under white tops or bottoms.
>Combine your colours and wear appropriate colours for your skin type. E.g. If you are dark skinned, bright colours are recommended.
>Exposing our bodies does not make us fashionable.
>Dress like a princess remembering that you are the much-loved daughter of The King of kings.
>You are not your own; your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
