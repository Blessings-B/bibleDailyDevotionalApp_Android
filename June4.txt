JUNE 4th

Spot the Bully
 'When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem...' Matthew 2:16

Text: Matthew 2:12-18

The word 'bully' brings certain words to mind, including aggressive, strong and arrogant. We rarely associate that word with godly, considerate or helpful but bullies exist everywhere. A bully is someone who verbally or physically inflicts harm, pain or distress to another`s property or person with the intention of upsetting or influencing them to act in negative or self-harming ways.
In today`s text, Herod lets his anger and insecurity turn him into a bully who commands the killing of children and the destruction of property. This type of bullying still occurs. However, social media has created bullies who attack and destroy people`s public image. All these are wrong in God`s sight.

FURTHER STUDY: Isaiah 41:11-13; Psalm 138:7
PRAYER: Lord, help me control my emotions, to respect the property and personality of another, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Let your actions be motivated by positive, not negative emotion.  Always consider how you would feel in another`s position.
