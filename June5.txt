What Makes a Bully?
His brothers were jealous of him,Â but his father kept the matter in mind.                                      Genesis 37:11

Text: Genesis 37:1-36

Psychologists who work with victims of bullies and former bullies have identified various reasons behind the actions of bullies. Amongst these are low self-esteem, jealousy and a desire to belong.
In today`s text, Joseph`s brothers displayed all these qualities. They were jealous of his multicolored coat, they felt insulted by his dreams, which showed him as someone favored by God and they acted as a group to sell him into slavery. 
Reuben`s behavior is especially interesting. Throughout the entire process, he did not wholeheartedly support his brothers` actions. However, the need to belong outweighed his sense of right and wrong. Have you ever been in such a situation?

PRAYER: Father teach me to guard my heart against these emotions, to find my peace and contentment in you, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Be careful to separate yourself from these three traits.
