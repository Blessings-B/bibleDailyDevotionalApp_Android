JUNE 6th

Victims of A Bully
'...Three times a day he got down on his kneesÂ and prayed, giving thanks to his God,
just as he had done before'. Daniel 6:10

Text: Daniel 6:1-16

A farmer kept poultry with 1,400 chickens, all free to roam about the farm.  One day he decides to expand his range of birds and introduces a full-grown turkey. The immediate response of the chickens was to flap their wings and isolate the newcomer. If you could understand chicken speech, you would have heard them clucking about the arrogance of the newcomer, the color of its feathers etc. 
Bullies always pick on people who are different from them, just like the administrators and satraps in our text today picked on Daniel. You MAY never know why a person picks on you but it is important to act like Daniel and focus on staying true to your values in line with God`s Word.

FURTHER STUDY: 2 Timothy 2:20-26; Psalm 141:9
PRAYER: Father, help me to remember that my behavior should not be dependent on how people treat me but on your Word, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Stay true to your values.
