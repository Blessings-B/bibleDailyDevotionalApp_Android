Finding Inner Strength
'...our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace...'                                      Daniel 3:17

Text: Daniel 3:4-30

Sometimes life poses difficult questions at us, making us wonder who and whose we are. Facing a bully is one of those situations where knowing our identity is important and prevents us from becoming bitter or giving into fear. We are God`s children and His promises for us are good and pleasant, but it does not mean we will not face troubles or challenges. In fact, identifying ourselves as His children can mark us as targets for troubles.
Nevertheless, God has great plans for His children; plans to deliver and to save. This fact is true even when you are dealing with a terrifying bully. Like the three Hebrew boys, we must remain sure of whom we believe in. He will deliver and save.

FURTHER STUDY: Romans 8:30-39; 1 Corinthians 10:10-15
PRAYER: Father, we pray that you give us the grace to patiently become mature sons in deed and in words, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Give yourself time to grow in confidence and identity just as a child grows in stature.
