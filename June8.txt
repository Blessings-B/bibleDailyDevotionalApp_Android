Finding Inner Strength II
...But David found strength in the Lord his God.                                                                                1 Samuel 30:6b

Text: 1 Samuel 30:1 -10

When we feel, worried or upset, it is encouraging to hear a friendly voice that knows the right thing to say to make it all better. However, our lives and those of others around us get busier as we get older. Thus, it becomes important to learn to draw strength from the Lord who knows us better than anyone else.
David looked within him and remembered his past victories and trials. He also remembered the God who had stood by him through them all. You might say 'but I have no victories'. Well, remember the God who has kept you thus far from every trouble and determine in your heart to hold onto Him through every storm of life.

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 27:1; Isaiah 40:29-31
PRAYER: Father, please grant me wisdom to know what battles to undertake and strength to fight them your way, in Jesus name Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: When you face intimidating situations, ask for strength to face them boldly and overcome.
