Speak Up for Others
Blessed is the man that walks not ...nor sits in the seat of the scornful.                                               Psalm 1:1 (NKJV)

Text: Psalm 1:1-6

Bullies need an atmosphere of fear and the lack of godly advice to thrive.  It is interesting that the scripture does not separate the person who is scornful from the person who sits with the scornful. God assigns the same fate to both.
By being silent or ignoring the act, we act like the person who sits in the seat of the scornful. I am not asking that you put yourself in harm`s way without caution. Sometimes physically being there for a victim can push the bully a little step away. This can cause others to begin questioning the bully`s authority. 
We should never accept a bully`s way of doing things as right, or share in the benefits of such actions.

FURTHER STUDY: John 8:1-11
PRAYER: Father, give me the grace to speak up for myself and for all those who cannot speak for themselves.
TIP OF THE DAY: Be respectful, be dignified; speak up for others. When we do not make a stance for justice, we indirectly/silently support injustice.
