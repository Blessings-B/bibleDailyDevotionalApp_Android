Fragrance of Love

But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him. 2 Corinthians 2:14
Text: 2 Peter 1:5-8

Certain perfumes and body lotions appeal to us partly because of the fragrance they produce. Once we apply them, the fragrance goes wherever we go, impacting anyone we encounter.
This is also true of attitude and presence. What fragrance is produced from you, especially when you are under pressure? This is proof of what you contain. It can affect your environment and people around you positively or negatively. So, nurture the love of Christ in you so that you can have a healthy love for yourself and others. This is necessary to build the right environment (of trust, grace, peace, forgiveness, and love), which ensures your continuous growth and establishment as a Christian.  

FURTHER STUDY: Ephesians 3:18-19; Psalm 119:64; John 12:3

PRAYER: Dear Lord, I receive your love into my heart and the grace to release that love to all I meet in Jesus name, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: Store Godâ€™s Word in you and practice it so that your fragrance can be beautiful to all.
