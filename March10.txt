Growing Pains (Pruning)

He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that bears fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful. John 15: 2
Text: John 15: 1-2

Part of the process of growth is change. This change can sometimes be in the form of losing things we no longer need, in order for what we do need to grow. Like how we lose our milk teeth for the permanent ones.
As growing Christians, we are constantly letting go of the old ways of the flesh and learning the ways of the Spirit. This means letting go of lying, stealing, envy, malice and taking on truthfulness, contentment, kindness, love. In gardening, this is called pruning, the gardener prunes the tree to make it more fruitful; removing the old growth to make way for the new.

PRAYER: Prune me, Lord, it may not be pleasant, but I will be more fruitful, in Jesus name, Amen.
