Growing Pains (Discipline and Trials)

Endure suffering along with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy 2:3(NLT)
Text: 2 Timothy 2:3-5

A diamond is formed from coal that has been under such a high degree of pressure that one cannot imagine. Gold is purified by fire. The hotter the flame, the purer the gold will be. Precious pearls are formed when oysters get hurt.
My point? Trials come to bring out the best in us. When we pass through trials they help us grow. In trials, we discover how patient we are, how kind we can be, how strong we are. In essence, the untapped riches in us. Trials may be hard but God allows them for us to grow. 
Discipline, on the other hand, is something we have to apply to ourselves if we are to grow. We will not always feel like praying or reading our bible or telling someone about Jesus, but discipline involves putting our body under. Telling the truth even when it may get us into trouble, and doing what God wants irrespective of what our flesh is screaming for us to do, these all require discipline. Training in godliness is profitable in all things.

FURTHER STUDY: James 1:2-4; Hebrews 12:1-7; 1 Timothy 4:8

PRAYER: Lord teach me to hold on through trials and discipline as they bring forth your life in me, in Jesus name, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: Examine yourself, in what areas can you use some discipline?
