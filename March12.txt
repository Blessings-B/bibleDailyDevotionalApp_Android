What Is Soul Winning?
He said to them, 'Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.
Mark 16:15
Text: Mark 16:15-18

Think of how your life was before you made Jesus Christ your friend. You were a sinner, separated from God and on your way to hell. But when you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Saviour, you found peace, joy, and hope, your sins were forgiven and you are now on your way to heaven! This is every believer`s story - a story of total transformation.
Now that we have received the love of God into our hearts, God wants us to tell everyone all that He has done for us because He wants to do exactly the same thing in their lives! He is counting on us to be the ones to tell them about this.
Soul winning is the heartbeat of God. His greatest desire is that all men will know Him as friend. If we truly love God, we will show it by being instruments through which He can fulfill this desire. We will talk about Jesus and His salvation to everyone-family, friends, classmates, colleagues and neighbours.
