What Is the Gospel?
	'How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!'
Romans 10:15b (NKJV)

Text: John 3:16

It is our responsibility to tell everyone about Jesus but we must know what to say. The gospel means `good news`. It is the good news of the benefits we gain from the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. When Adam sinned against God, our relationship with God became severed and we were plunged into darkness. Man could no longer relate with God and was condemned to die but God so desperately wanted our relationship with Him back that He did the unthinkable...He gave His only child and son, Jesus Christ, to die in our stead!
By His death, Jesus paid the price for our sin once and for all and anyone that believes in this sacrifice is restored to a loving fellowship with God. Whoever believes receives grace to live a life that pleases God and will go to heaven to be with Jesus forever. The gospel is not a message of condemnation or hate, but of hope, forgiveness, and love. That is why it is called the GOOD NEWS!

FURTHER STUDY: Luke 4:18-19; 2 Corinthians 5:17-21; Acts 8:4-8 
PRAYER: Dear Jesus, help me to let people know that your shed blood is available to bridge them back to you, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Your message to the world should bring freedom and joy.
