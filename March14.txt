Why Should I Win Souls?
Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe
stands condemned already because they have not believed
in the name of God`s one and only Son. John 3:18

Text: John 3:17-18

There are several reasons why we MUST win souls and they include:
>It is a commandment. Jesus gave us the COMMANDMENT to go out into the world and win souls. It is an instruction we must obey and disobedience to this instruction is a sin. NOT winning souls is a sin because Jesus expressly told us to go and win souls. 
>There is the danger of going to hell for any soul that is not won. This means that the person will spend eternity in hellfire. Hell is a very horrible place that you would not even wish for your worst enemies. It is a place of eternal torment, pain, and separation from God. 
Take out a minute and think of all your unsaved friends and family members. Do you want them to end up in hell? Bring them to Jesus now, tomorrow might be late.

FURTHER STUDY: Mark 16:15; Ezekiel 18:4, 20
PRAYER: Dear Lord I pledge to win souls for you by your grace from today onwards in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Talk to at least one person about God every day.
