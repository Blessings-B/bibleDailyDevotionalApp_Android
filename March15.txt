How Do I Win Souls?
Come; see a man who told me everything I ever did. John 4:29a

Text: John 4:6-30

Winning souls must be done deliberately and consciously. Below is a practical guide to soul-winning.
>Have a target. Focus on someone or a group of people, probably your friend, class, a family member etc. 
>Pray. We have to pray intensely for whoever we want to win. Prayer is like rain that softens the soil to receive the words you speak which are seeds. If the ground (i.e. the heart) is not tilled and soft, the seeds would not penetrate and take root.
>Share the good news with your target. Make an oral presentation of the gospel, encourage that person to make a decision and lead him in the `Sinner`s Prayer`. This is a prayer of repentance that involves confessing the Lordship of Jesus Christ.
>Live the life. We have to be an example of what we preach. We cannot afford to live carelessly. When our character and lifestyle do not match what we preach, no one will listen to us.

PRAYER: Dear Jesus, make me an effective witness. May my life, not just as my lips, preach the gospel in your name I pray, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Publicly declare Christ and let your life win souls to God
