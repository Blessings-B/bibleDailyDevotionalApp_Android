Prayer and Soul Winning
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind
on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on
earth will be loosed in heaven.' Matthew 16:19

Text: 2 Corinthians 4:3-4

Soul winning is warfare. The devil wants people bound so that he can eventually take them to hell. He has placed a veil over the spiritual eyes and minds of many so that they will not embrace the gospel despite hearing it severally.
To get people saved, we must tear off this satanic veil over their hearts in the place of prayer, bind the hands of the devil over them and ask for utterance and boldness to say the exact Spirit-inspired words that will convict our friends or family members as we witness to them. God can only touch our tongue in the place of prayer.
Do not stop praying or witnessing to the person until the veil is destroyed and the light of salvation shines through. Prayer and soul-winning are intertwined. We cannot do one without the other.

FURTHER STUDY: Ephesians 1:15-19; Luke 21:15; 1 Timothy 2:1
PRAYER: Sweet Holy Spirit, pour upon me the grace of prayer right now. Make me an intercessor and a warrior. Give me the strength and tenacity to pray until I see the salvation of those I am praying for in Jesus name, Amen!
TIP OF THE DAY: Pray for the people around you to get saved.
