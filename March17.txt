After Soul Winning, What Next?
Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may
grow up in your salvation, 1 Peter 2:2

Text: Galatians 4:19

Salvation is not an end but a beginning of a new and beautiful journey with Jesus. Getting saved can be likened to being born. After a baby is born, the baby is expected to grow and mature else everyone gets worried because it is a sign that something is wrong. Just like a mother that just gave birth to a new baby, our responsibility as soul winners is to ensure that the souls we have won grow and abide in the kingdom. What do we do?
>Take your baby home. We are to take our converts along with us to church. 
>Make sure they study the Bible. The Word of God is the milk and meat they need to grow. 
>Ensure they register in a foundation school in a church where they get mentorship from mature brethren.
>Encourage them to join a department in church which serves as a platform for discipleship.
Never stop praying for your converts until Christ is formed in them.

PRAYER: I thank you, Father, for this awesome privilege to disciple men. I trust you for grace to get the job done effectively in Jesus name, Amen.
