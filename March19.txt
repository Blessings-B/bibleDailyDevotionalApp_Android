Of Great Value
Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.
Proverbs 4:23

Text: Proverbs 4:20-27

To guard means - to defend, protect, shepherd, act as a chaperone or watch over. You only protect something that is precious and valuable.  When I travel and have to stay in a hotel, I put my valuable items in a safe place like the hotel safe.  Why? Because losing these could cost me a lot. 
God considers our spiritual hearts to be of great value because it is the very essence of who we are and the source of all we say and do. The condition of our hearts is important because it can help or hinder our walk with God. Because it is of such great value, we should place it in a safe and secure place - in His hands.  

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 23:26; Romans 12:2
PRAYER: Dear Jesus, today I give my heart to you. I know you will keep it safe and bring your good plans for me to come to pass in my life. Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Do not lock your heart away, leave it with Jesus.
