Selfishness

"The entire law is summed up in a single command: "Love your neighbor as yourself"." Galatians 5:14a
Text: Philippians 2:1-7

What does it mean to be selfish? It is equal to a lack of consideration for other people or a concern primarily for one's own interest. It sounds harsh, right? But think about it. When the world screams 'survival of the fittest' and loudly proclaims that life is a rat race, it is easy to forget who you are and what you carry.
When you make your decisions, do you give due consideration to the effect it would have on your neighbor? Does it matter to you that another could get hurt or disappointed? When you come before God's mercy seat, is it only for yourself? Anyone who thinks the world revolves around him is myopic and unable to see that such is a limited world.

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 11:24-27; Romans 13:8-10; Ephesians 4:31-5:1

PRAYER: Lord, the world is more than I, me and myself. Help me to consider others in any decision I take in Jesus name, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: Wear your neighbor's shoes as you make your decisions.
