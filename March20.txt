MARCH 20th

Time for A Deep Clean
'Search me, God, and know my heart ...' Psalm 139:23

Text: Psalm 139:23-24

I keep my home clean every day by tidying up and flicking a cloth around often used areas in the home. Sometimes, I do a deep clean by cleaning and scrubbing hard-to-reach areas inside and outside. This takes more time because the dirt has accumulated over time and become difficult to get rid of.
In our key text, King David asks the Lord to examine his heart. This is called a God-examination and is different from self-examination. When we examine our hearts, it is similar to me flicking a cloth around my kitchen. It looks tidy but does not get the hidden dirt below the surface. 
When God examines our hearts, He shows us areas where secret sins, including pride and self-righteousness, have hidden. We need to confess these and receive the help of the Holy Spirit to think and live right.

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 119:59; Psalm 51:10
PRAYER: Dear Jesus, examine me today and show me what needs to be uprooted from my heart. Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Daily God-examination through prayer keeps your heart spotless.
