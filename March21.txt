Feed Yourself
'I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you'.
Psalm 119:11

Text: Psalm 119:9-16
Our human bodies need fuel in the form of food for us to survive on earth. The foods we eat provide us with a range of nutrients: vitamins, minerals, water, fat, carbohydrates, fibre, and protein. If we feed our bodies with healthy food, they grow stronger; if we feed them with junk food, they grow weaker and susceptible to diseases.
In the same way, our spiritual hearts are nourished by the Word of God we read, hear, memorize and practice. This helps us to do the good God wants us to do and to stop the bad habits He wants us to stop.

FURTHER STUDY: Luke 4:4; 1 Peter 2:2
PRAYER: Dear Jesus, give me a hunger and a thirst for your Word.  Help me to hide it in my heart. Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: A balanced diet of the Word of God is the secret to a healthy heart.
