You Are What You Think
For as he thinks in his heart, so is he. Proverbs 23:7a (NKJV)

Text: Proverbs 23:1-8

To think means to have something in mind, have an opinion or an intention, reflect or ponder on something. To succeed in life, it is important to think the right thoughts, have the right opinions and form the right mindset.
God tells us in Proverbs that we have the power to determine what we become by what we think in our hearts.  The complete picture of who God wants us to become is revealed by Jesus who is the Word of God. Therefore, the more we study the Bible and reflect on it, the more we become the girls and young women He wants us to be; bold, confident young women who love God and allow His nature (Galatians 5:22) to shine through us.  

FURTHER STUDY: Psalms 19:7-14; 1 Peter 3:3-4
PRAYER: Dear Jesus, help me keep watch over the thoughts of my heart. Let them always be in line with your Word. Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Find out what God has said about you in the Bible. Think on it. Pray about it
