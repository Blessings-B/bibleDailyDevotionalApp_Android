MARCH 23rd

Where Is Your Treasure?
 'For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also'. Luke 12:34

Text: Luke 12:22-34

As young girls in today`s world, there are lots of things that demand our attention e.g. friends, boys, fashion, personal image, the number of likes, friends or followers on social media etc. What you focus on every moment becomes your treasure.
In our key text, Jesus wants us to focus our attention on God and the things of God; to make Him the priority in our daily lives.  Someone once said, 'What you focus on becomes bigger, what you neglect becomes smaller'. The more attention you give to God`s Word, the more you come to value your relationship with Him and the greater the influence He has on your heart, life and decisions. 

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 1:1-3; Colossians 3:2; Matthew 6:33
PRAYER: Dear Jesus, help my attention to be focused on You. Let Your word be the key influence in my life. Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Set time aside at the start of the day to speak to God and to hear from Him through His Word.
