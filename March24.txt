Forgiveness-A Daily Obedience
 '...and a serpent will bite him who breaks through a wall'. Ecclesiastes 10:8 (ESV)

Text: Ecclesiastes 10:8-9


Why do I need to forgive? For my own good! God has surrounded my heart with His love and protection. When I refuse to forgive, my heart becomes hardened and I am walking in disobedience to Him (Mark 11:25). This creates a hole in the wall of protection He has surrounded me with and the devil can sneak in and attack me and my family.
So, what should I do when I have been hurt? Immediately pray and tell God that I forgive the other person. Each time I remember the offence, I pray again. If I can and if it will not expose me to harm, I can go out of my way to do something nice for the other person. I will keep asking God to help me and to take away the hurt and anger in my heart. And He always does! 

FURTHER STUDY: Luke 6:27; Colossians 3:13
PRAYER: Dear Jesus, help me to forgive from my heart, anyone that has hurt me. Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Has anyone offended you? Forgive immediately!
