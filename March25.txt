Let Peace Rule
And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
Philippians 4:7 (ESV)

Text: Philippians 4:6-8

Peace comes from God (John 14:27) and refers to the calmness in your inner man despite any chaos in your external environment. Your confidence in God`s ability to meet your daily needs, despite what you MAY see or hear, results in peace in your heart.
When peace is on guard, you have entered a secure fortress from which nothing can dislodge you. The name of the fortress is Christ, and the security guard is peace. The peace of God stands guard and keeps worry from destroying your heart and unworthy thoughts from tearing up your mind.

FURTHER STUDY: Colossians 3:15; Philippians 4:8
PRAYER: Dear Jesus, fill my heart with your peace which passes human understanding and let it secure my heart in your promises for me. Amen
TIP OF THE DAY: Think on God`s promises. He is the same yesterday, today and forever. He never fails.
