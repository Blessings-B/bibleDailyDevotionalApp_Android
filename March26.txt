The Sin Complex
'For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world,
but to save the world through him' John 3:17

Text: Genesis 3:6-7

What happens when we commit sin after we have accepted Jesus? Can a believer, lose his/her salvation and require salvation again? 
Sin is a separator, it separates us from God! Though our relationship with God cannot be broken, our fellowship with Him can! Have you noticed that when you feel guilty because of sin, you avoid praying, reading your Bible, going to church, or even your Christian friends! These are pointers to a damaged fellowship with God.
Adam and Eve had been naked and unashamed since creation, feeling no guilt. They freely fellowshipped with God with nothing to hide until they ate the fruit (sinned) and their eyes were opened! With eyes wide open now, they had stepped into the `sin complex`. Often, we do not follow God`s directions towards redeeming us. Sometimes we delay before accepting that we have sinned. And time is all guilt needs to eat its corrosive way into our conscience. 

FURTHER STUDY: Romans 8:1-2; 1 John 1:9; 2:1- 2; Romans 3:25-26 
PRAYER: Have mercy on me Oh Lord and forgive my trespasses. Give me the mind of Christ that I MAY run to you when I fall.
TIP OF THE DAY: When it comes to sin and confession, do not procrastinate! Confess now!
