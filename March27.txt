The Cover-up
'Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses 
and renounces them finds mercy' Proverbs 28:13

Text: Genesis 3:7; 2 Samuel 11:1-end

Adam and Eve sinned and tried to cover it up! They did not want God`s `cover`. Sin is bad in itself and when we try and cover it up, it begets another sin. Guilt then comes in as we begin to struggle under the weight of all the cover-ups!
David`s story is an excellent example of the cover-up process. He slept with another man`s wife who became pregnant. He ordered her husband Uriah to come home so it would look like the child was his; cover-up number one! That did not work, so David gave instructions to put Uriah on the front battle lines so he would be killed; cover-up number 2! Uriah died in battle, and David married her - the perfect cover-up...or so he thought!
Sin let off a chain reaction of cover-ups; from adultery to trying to get him drunk to murder! Wisdom says confess your sin instead of covering it up. We would never do a good job of it anyway!

FURTHER STUDY: Micah 7:8-9, 18- 19; Psalm 51:1-19; 32:1-5 
PRAYER: Help me not to cover my sins Lord that I MAY obtain mercy, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Always stop to think about the consequences of that cover up and ask, `Is it worth it?'.
