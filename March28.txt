MARCH 28th

Enter the Accuser of The Brethren
Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret,
but worldly sorrow brings death 2 Corinthians 7:10

Text: Job 1:9-11

How the devil must have hated the sight of Job! To see the righteous man surrounded by his children, wealth and all-round prosperity must have been a little too much for him. Then, God boasted about him! So, he did the only thing he is good at, he accused Job of worshipping God for gain! 
The nature of the devil is to accuse us even when we have not sinned! Job was being accused while he had no sin, so you can imagine what a field day the devil would have if Job had sinned.
The nature of the devil has not changed; he still takes pleasure in reminding us of past sins confessed and unconfessed. We have an enemy whose main purpose is to keep us from serving the Lord. In Scripture, he is called the 'accuser' of the brethren. If you continue to feel guilty for forgiven sins, that is the devil, not the Holy Spirit. 

FURTHER STUDY: Ephesians 6:11; James 4:7; Revelations 12:10-11
PRAYER: Lord, restore to me the joy of salvation, and uphold me with a firm spirit, immune to the accusations of the devil, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Reject the fiery darts he shoots at your mind by holding up the shield of faith and the finished work of Christ.
