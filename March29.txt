MARCH 29th

The Sea of Forgetfulness
For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember
their sins no more. Hebrew 8:12

Text: Micah 7:19

What could be more reassuring than knowing that no matter how many times we sin, we can arise like the prodigal son, go back to our Father who takes us back and hurls our sins into the sea! Now if a Holy God who cannot stand sin (He turned His back on Jesus on the cross) forgives us always, we need to forgive ourselves too!
I have met people who carry a burden of guilt over a past sin. They have confessed it but do not think they deserve to be forgiven and so beat themselves up every chance they get. Accepting God`s forgiveness is an act of will; it takes conscious effort!
Jesus, by his life and death, purchased our forgiveness and provided our righteousness. We can add nothing to the purchase or provision except share in the forgiveness and the righteousness by faith alone. In view of God`s holiness and sin`s evil, it is fitting that we appropriate and apply what He bought for us by prayer/confession anytime we err. 

FURTHER STUDY: Micah 7:8, 18; 1 John 1:8-9; Matthew 6:11-12
PRAYER: Teach me to forgive myself as You have forgiven me that I do not make the blood of Jesus of non-effect by my guilt, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: God has forgiven you; it`s now left to you to forgive yourself!
