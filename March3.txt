Staying in Harm's Way

 "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy". John 10:10a
Text: Psalms 1:1-3

To walk, stand and sit are three growth processes expected in the life of a Christian. Where and with whom you walk, stand or sit has a great impact on your life; they either keep you safe or place you in harm's way. You are valuable and created for honor. Are you walking, standing or sitting where thieves dwell?
Thieves come only to steal, kill and destroy the treasures deposited in you by God, intended to bless your world. Examples of thieves in your path, which could expose you to danger, are bitterness (steals joy), envy and worry (steal peace), laziness and procrastination (steal time), spendthrift (steals money), bad habits and carelessness (steal health). When you interact with the wrong human company or display the wrong attitude, you place yourself in harm's way and compromise your safety.

FURTHER STUDY: Isaiah 56:7; Mark 11:7; Luke 19:46

PRAYER: Father, if I have placed myself in harmâ€™s way show me and help me on the right path.

TIP OF THE DAY: Give a quit notice to all the thieves lurking around you.
