MARCH 30th

Guilt: The Good
Create in me a pure heart,O God, and renew a steadfast spirit
within me. Psalm 51: 10

Text: 2 Samuel 12: 20

Finally, David rises from the fasting and place of guilt after the death of his child. David`s guilt drives him towards God. Passionately committed to being changed, He asks God not to cast him away from His presence. Some MAY disagree with this prayer because of the finished work of Christ on Calvary as it MAY imply one has lost salvation. I could not agree less.
David prays for a heart and a spirit that are new and right. He knew he was guilty of sin, displeasing God but his guilt was good as it drove him into the forgiving arms of the Father. Guilt can drive us towards or away from God. Towards: leads us back to a right relationship with Him, more convinced of the Father`s love thereby making us more effective in our work for Him. Guilt can be a merciless taskmaster that drives us far from God. How we respond to guilt determines if we go the `good` or `ugly` way.

FURTHER STUDY: Romans 8:1, 33; Hebrew 9:14; 10:19-20, 22
PRAYER: Holy Spirit I ask that as you convict me of sin, the guilt I feel will drive me towards the love of the Father, Amen.
