Guilt: The Bad
If we claim to be without sin,we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins 
and purify us from all unrighteousness. 1 John 1:8-9

Text: Luke 22:60-62

Peter denied Jesus 3 times! The guilt and shame Peter must have felt can only be imagined. The enemy of our soul tries to use guilt to keep us from the Lord with accusations that leave us feeling unforgiven. This brings shame, anger, bitterness, and depression driving us from God`s presence, this is bad guilt!
Peter probably dwelt in this shame because we find him abandoning the charge of feeding the flock and returning to fishing with some disciples! He allowed the burden of guilt to affect those he had been entrusted with. It is no surprise then that he did not recognize Jesus when He appeared to them after the resurrection; jumping into the sea in shame when he finally did!
If you have repented of your sins but still feel the accuser lurking in the shadows, confront the accusations with God`s Word. 

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 32, John 8:36, Revelations. 12:10
PRAYER: Holy Spirit MAY I not lead others away from you by focusing on my guilt, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Do not allow the enemy prey on your guilt; walk in that freedom and grace for which the price has been fully paid!
