A Time Away

"Do not stare at me because I am dark, because I am darkened by the sun. My mother's
sons were angry with me and made me take care of the vineyards;
my own vineyard I have neglected". Song of Solomon 1:6
Text: Psalm 127:1-2

Have you ever felt drained and boxed in? Does it sometimes feel as if life has thrown more than you can chew and you need more than 24hrs? If you answered yes to any of these questions, be kind to yourself and take out time to recharge. Even the best of cars need to stop over to refuel else it may stop en route, in the middle of nowhere.
The key verse highlights the consequences of neglecting your own vineyard. Every organization knows employees need time away from work, to rest, refresh and birth new ideas. This is why different kinds of leave are provided. Do not be caught neglecting yourself or you will burn out and not be useful for anything good!

FURTHER STUDY: Ecclesiastes 3:1; John 9:4; Hebrews 4:4

PRAYER: Lord, help me follow the example set by you, and take time away to refuel, in Jesus name, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: Learn to say no to some activities so you can REST.
