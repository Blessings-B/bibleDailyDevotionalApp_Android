A New Creation, A New Man

Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. 2 Corinthians. 5:17
Text: 2 Corinthians 5:14-21

When we become born again, we have a new nature that we do not know much about. Growing up spiritually is about discovering who we are in Christ. The way we think, act, speak, relate to others and to circumstances needs to be relearned.
Itâ€™s like being a baby and needing to learn to walk, talk, dress etc. Truth is we need to learn the way of life of the new kingdom we belong to. Thankfully our loving heavenly Father has made provisions for us to be able to learn what we need to know.

FURTHER STUDY: Romans 6:17-23, 8:1-4 

PRAYER: Heavenly Father help me to grow into the daughter you have called me to be, in Jesus name, Amen.
