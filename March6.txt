Food

As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word,
that ye may grow thereby: 1 Peter 2:2 (KJV)
 Text: 1 Peter 1:23-2:3

For us to grow physically we need food. Similarly, for our spirits to grow and become strong we need spiritual food. Our text for the day tells us that our spiritual food is the word of God. How do we eat this food? By reading, studying, memorizing and meditating on the word of God, just like you are doing now.
Reading the word would be like eating, taking in the word of God. While taking time to meditate on it would be akin to digesting the word. Often as we meditate (think on, ponder) on the word of God, hidden meanings which we may not have seen spring up. It should be a part of you, to daily spend time studying and meditating on the word of God.

FURTHER STUDY: Ephesians 4:11-16; Acts 20:32

PRAYER: As we eat daily from your table Lord, cause us to grow to be more like you, in Jesus name, Amen.
