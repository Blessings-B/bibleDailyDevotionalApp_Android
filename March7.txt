Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves.
Do what it says. James 1:22
Text: James 1:22-25

Itâ€™s not enough to know the word of God. It is more important to know and do what the word of God says. Romans 6:16 tells us that whoever we yield our bodies to by obeying becomes master over us. As we yield ourselves to obeying God (the word of God) every day, in every way and in every area of our lives, we grow stronger in our new nature and Christ truly reigns in our lives.
Still, in the book of Romans, God lets us know that if we sow to the Spirit, we reap life but if we sow to the flesh we reap death. The sowing there refers to investing your time and energy in obeying or doing the things, either of the Spirit or of the flesh. Obeying the word of God is like exercise as we do it we become stronger and healthier. We grow in our spirits. 

FURTHER STUDY: Hebrews 5:13-14; Romans 6:11-14

PRAYER: Dear heavenly Father, thank you for the opportunity to be your child. As I go through today I choose to exercise in your word. I choose life over death. I choose to obey your word, in Jesus name, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: Commit to doing what the word of God says, in whatever situation you find yourself in.
