Abiding in Prayer

Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will
rest in the shadow of the Almighty. Psalm 91:1

Text: John 15:4-11

If you have done agriculture or know anything about growing plants, you would know that it’s not only nutrients that plants need to grow. They need the right environment. The type of soil, the amount of water and sunlight create the right environment for each plant.
Prayer creates the right environment for us to grow spiritually. Prayer is not just talking to God. It is hearing from Him also. In this environment of love, we are nourished and cherished and we cannot help but bloom and grow. Praying in the words that we know and understand and praying in the Spirit (in tongues), all play a part in making our spirits grow as we are bathed with the sunlight of God’s presence. Abiding in the vine does not refer only to studying the word of God but also to dwelling in the secret place of the Most High. Dwelling in prayer.

FURTHER STUDY: Mark 1:35; Matthew 14:23; Luke 6:12

PRAYER: Father give me the grace to learn to abide in your presence. May I always long for more of you, in Jesus name, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: Create a regular quiet time. When you can talk to God and hear Him speak.
