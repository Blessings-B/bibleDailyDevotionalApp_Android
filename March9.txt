Nutrients for Growth

But you, dear friends by building yourselves up in the most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit Jude 20
Text: John 16:7- 15

Jesus promised us the Holy Spirit and for good reasons. It would be difficult if not impossible to live the life expected of us as Christians without the Holy Spirit.
He teaches us, leads us, empowers us. He convicts us, helps us pray, leads us into all truth. You cannot have any growth or make progress as a Christian without the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

FURTHER STUDY: Acts 1:4-8; Romans 8:14-17

PRAYER: Lord Jesus you promised us the Holy Spirit to be our helper and guide. I come to you now with an open heart ready to receive your promise. Lord baptize me today with the Holy Spirit, in Jesus name, Amen.

TIP OF THE DAY: Are you baptized in the Holy Spirit?
