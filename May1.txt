R-E-L-A-X, You Deserve It.
 'A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.'
 Proverbs 17:22 (KJV)

Text: Proverbs 17:22

A great way to get the best out of your 'me ' time is to RELAX. Here are a few things you can do.
R is for READ ... did I hear you say, 'here we go again'? LOL. Well, yes it has been said before and I`ll say it again READ. Get as much information about all the topics that interest you. Read a cookbook, newspaper, your bible, your little sister`s nursery rhymes can even bring out the poet in you. 
E is for EAT. Yes, you have God`s permission to but do so in moderation. Try cooking and reward yourself with your meal. 
L is for Laugh. Its proven to be a great way to relieve stress. You would know that if you read. 
A is for Appreciate. If something is good be thankful and more of it will come your way.
X is not for a word, it`s for an activity. Make a list of the things that make you feel less than who God says you are and draw a big fat X over them. 

FURTHER STUDY:  1 Kings 8:56
PRAYER: Father I thank you because you love and care about me. Nothing good do you withhold from me. Hallelujah. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Make another list of who God says you are.
