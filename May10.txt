MAY 10th

Friends, To Have or Not To Have?
A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity.                                 Proverbs 18:24

Text: I Samuel 18:1-4

For some of us, making friends is easy, a breeze, we don`t even think about it twice. For others, well... it`s a bit of a challenge. What do I say? How do I keep the friendship going? What if he/she rejects me? These questions and more can plague one and keep one paralyzed, unable to take that first step. But nothing in life is without some risk.
Our text doesn`t exactly say who approached whom first, but Jonathan could have thought, `with all of David`s battle successes would he talk to me? Or David, `He`s the son of the King, it`s probably not a good idea to try talking to him.` Whoever took the first step doesn`t really matter, what resulted was a beautiful friendship that lasted beyond their lifetimes. 
We can have such too. Ask God to bring the right friends your way, to guide your feet to the people he has destined to help you on this journey. But when He brings them you still have to take that step and reach out. A true friend is a treasure, a rare gem. It is a gift from God and makes your journey on earth memorable.

PRAYER: Lord Jesus, please bless me with true friends this month.
