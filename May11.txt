MAY 11th

A Friend Like No Other
But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners,                             Christ died for us. Romans 5:8

Text:  John 15:13-14

Have you desired a close, personal friendship where you can be loved, heard, appreciated and accepted? MAYbe you`re still looking for that one person you can connect with. Jesus is the best friend you can ever have. He loves, cares, listens, encourages, gives, and forgives like no one does. He is the only one that truly understands your feelings desires and innermost secrets (Hebrew 4:15). 
Guess what? He wants to have a close friendship with you. He wants to fill that emptiness in your life with so much love and joy. He hurts when we reject Him and go our own way. He hurts because He knows He has the answers we are looking for, yet we reject him. Ask Him to be your closest friend. Once you do, He accepts you and begins a loving relationship with you. Make Jesus your friend today.

FURTHER STUDY: John 15:13, James 4:4
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, I thank you for giving up your life for me. I am sorry for hurting you in the past. Please forgive me and come into my life as my closest friend.
TIP OF THE DAY: Jesus thinks you are to die for, of a truth He already died for you.
