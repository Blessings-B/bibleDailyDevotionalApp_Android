Honouring God in Friendship
Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable-                                                               if anything is excellent or praiseworthy- think about such things.                                                     Philippians 4:8

Text: Romans 12:10

Making friends is one thing, honouring God through that friendship is another. Many friendships do not honour God. Our friends can become our gossip partners, competition, and `partners in crime`. What we do in friendship matters a lot. The activities we engage in with our friends determine whether our friendship honours or dishonours God. Are there friends whom after spending time with them you feel a need to go to God for repentance? You need to rethink those friendships. 
Aim to create godly memories with your friends, carrying out projects that put a smile on God`s face like outreaches, street evangelism, sharing the love of God with those who are less privileged and so much more. Carry out projects that challenge you and cause you to grow. Your friendship with people should leave them desiring more of God. It all begins with a decision to honour God.

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 1:1-3
PRAYER: Oh Lord, please help me to honour you in all my friendships.
 TIP OF THE DAY: Think of a God-worthy project for you and your friends.
