Dealing with Conflict in Friendship
Â 'If a brother sins against you, go to him privately and confront him with his fault. If he listens and confesses it, you have won back a brother.                                                                                          Mathew 18:15

Text: Matthew 18:15

In our dealings with our friends, conflict and offense will occur. The way we handle it, often determines how long our friendships last. Sometimes, it MAY seem easier to walk away from a friendship rather than addressing a serious conflict. But, working/walking through such problems and making amends is vital to maintaining worthwhile friendships. The Bible encourages us to talk to people that hurt us. Here are a few tips to keep in mind when doing that:
>Give yourself time to calm down, so that you can think, talk and act rationally.
>Treat/speak to your friend with respect.
>Listen to what your friend has to say with the aim of understanding them rather than with the hope of defending yourself.
>Choose your words wisely. Avoid accusatory phrases like 'you never,' 'you always.' 
>Always be ready to apologise sincerely.
>Let it go; if you can`t find common ground, agree to disagree and let it go.
