Daniel And His Friends
 `... showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand...` Daniel 1:4
Text: Daniel 1:3-4

Before these young people (probably teenagers) were selected for training, they had to show that they already knew a few things-- that they had the ability and talent to learn and they could understand concepts quickly.
They would not have developed these in one day. You too can start today.
If you want to be distinguished, you will need to develop the aptitude for Every kind of learning - including sciences, arts, business and current affairs.

FURTHER STUDY: Daniel 1:17; Proverbs 9:9
PRAYER: Lord, I ask that you help me develop an aptitude for every kind of learning, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: It`s never too early to start becoming well informed. Read wide. Perhaps you could set yourself a challenge to read at least 10 books (not just fiction or Christian books) in the next 12 months.
