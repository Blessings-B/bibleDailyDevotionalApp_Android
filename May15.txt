Store Up Knowledge
`The wise store up knowledge...` Proverbs 10: 14

Text: Proverbs 10:14

God made the brain in an amazing way. It is like a muscle, a sponge, and a store. Like a muscle, it gets stronger with use and exercise. Like a sponge, it takes in and gives out information. Like a store, it can keep information for later use.
The younger you are, the more the brain is able to grow, absorb information and store them. 
There is so much knowledge available from books, journals, and the internet. The wise would seek out knowledge and absorb it. If you wish to be wise, read your school books and your bible but also read other books, journals, and other informative materials. The brain will store them for later use.

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 8:12; Proverbs 18:15
PRAYER: Lord, help me find the books and other reading materials I need, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Read for the fun of it - you never know when the knowledge you store up would come in handy.
