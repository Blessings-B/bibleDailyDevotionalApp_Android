Add to Your Learning
`...and they will add to their learning` Proverbs 9:9b

Text: Proverbs 9:9

Do you know any `Mr or Miss know-it-all?` It is really difficult to teach them anything because they think they know it all.  However, everyone knows that they don`t know everything. The bible says the wise add to their learning.
So, there is always more to learn about a subject matter and there is more than one side to any matter. It is wise to try and read up different views and opinions on an issue for a balanced knowledge. For example, one person might say that `this glass is half full` and another says that `it is half empty`. If you only know about the `half full` view, you MAY not bother to go and find more water for a fill-up and if you only read about the `half empty` view, you MAY be discouraged. However, if you read and consider both sides, you would have a more realistic perspective.
Please note that the bible is the final authority in all things.

FURTHER STUDY: Ecclesiastes 12:11 
PRAYER: Father, give me a desire for knowledge, in Jesus name Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Don`t be a `know-it-all`. Keep your mouth shut and read.
