Reading Right

`Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable
 - think about such things`. Philippians 4:8

Text: Philippians 4:8 - 9

As a teenager, I loved reading (still do) and would spend hours with my nose buried in a book. I remember getting rid of a particular fiction because it was unhealthy for my mind. It took all my will because I really wanted to know what happened next but the Holy Spirit had been nudging me to get rid of it. After much struggle, I made a decision and burnt the book - I didn`t want to leave any room for temptation.
Be picky about the books you read (especially if they are fiction). Let their final message be noble, right, pure and admirable. Avoid pornographic books. There are plenty of other good books.

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 20:15; Proverbs 19:2
PRAYER: Father, help me to honour you in the things I read, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Mind the authors! Not every author is worth reading and some will need a good pinch of salt.
