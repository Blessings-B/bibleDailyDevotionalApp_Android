The Dull Axe
`If the axe is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed... `
Ecclesiastes 10: 10a

Text: Ecclesiastes 10:10

My brother once told me that if I need force to open something or fit a plug in, I am probably not doing it the right way. He was right! Since then, I have always first studied the parts before trying to fit them.
Sometimes, more strength is used because there is a lack of skill (ability and knowledge). For example, if you wish to communicate clearly to a large audience, you need to have a good understanding of your subject, know how to speak your chosen language of communication and then practice and practice until your speech comes naturally (without much struggle). Reading will expand your knowledge of your subject. Reading will improve your language skills. Then the rest is down to practice. 

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 22:2, 9; Proverbs 12:24
PRAYER: Father, help me to be diligent in study, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: If you are struggling in any area of learning or school subject, pick up the books and study them at least one hour every day.
