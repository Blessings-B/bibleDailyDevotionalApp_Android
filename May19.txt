The Example of Ezra
`For Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the Lord...` Ezra 7:10a

Text: Ezra 7:10

I heard about a young person who grew up in their village but went on to a university in town. He would study a whole chapter of the Bible every day before beginning his academic reading for the day. At the end of his course, he obtained a 1st Class and the second 1st Class in the history of his department! And the only 1st class in his department for that academic year! He had a really excellent result and he also gained a really good grasp of the scriptures. 
Like Ezra, he devoted himself to the study of God`s word. He is a worthy example to emulate. 

FURTHER STUDY: Colossians 2:3; Jeremiah 3:15.
PRAYER: Lord, I ask for the understanding to enable me to give myself to the study and observance of your word, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Read the bible cover to cover at least once in your youth. With the help of the Holy Spirit, you will find Christ, in whom are hidden ALL the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
