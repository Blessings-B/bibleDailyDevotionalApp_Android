The Devil`s Playground
Idle hands are the devil`s workshop; idle lips are his mouthpiece.
Proverbs 16:27 (TLB)

Text:  Proverbs 16:27-28

It`s not news that an idle mind is the devil`s workshop but I like to also see it as his playground. He sits in such a mind having fun, as he feeds us lies and paints deceptive pictures. He takes what God created as a beautiful mind, filled with possibilities and slowly destroys it. As children of God, we must not give the devil even an inch of space to take up residence in our minds. Feed on the word of God and your mind will become a NO PLAY ZONE to Satan.
Having read the word, keep busy, help out at home, help a friend in need, think of ways to be a blessing to others and you will find that you are so busy fulfilling purpose that the devil cannot distract you. 

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 15
PRAYER: Dear Lord, help me to resist the devil so that he will flee from me. I ask this in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Pray for someone else today and not yourself.
