Discipline and Knowledge
`Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge...` Proverbs 12:1a

Text: 	Proverbs 12:1

There are several ways we can interpret the scripture above:
>If you wish to obtain knowledge, you would need to apply discipline (self-control and focus).
>In order to learn, you need not be afraid of correction (of your work). Look at any comments the teachers have made on your work and revise it accordingly.
>If you don`t like correction, you will remain stupid (the Bible tells it like it is!).
>If you don`t do so well in an exam, don`t despair. See if you can find out why. Then read up and practise to cover any gaps in your knowledge.
>Read through books even if they make you uncomfortable by addressing some of your weaknesses or faults.
>When you study the bible, don`t gloss over quickly or ignore parts that feel like a rebuke or correction. Submit yourself to them and you will increase your knowledge of God.

PRAYER: Lord, please help me to be humble to receive correction. Teach me to apply discipline.
TIP OF THE DAY: Try reading through your reading list for each term. Ask your teachers for one if they have not provided it.
