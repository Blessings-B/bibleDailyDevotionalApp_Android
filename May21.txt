Your Health Is Important to God
 'Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, and raise the dead'
Matthew 10:8a (KJV)

Text: Matthew 10:5-8

When Jesus was on earth He healed many sick people and was moved with compassion whenever He saw someone suffering from an illness. God is concerned about our spiritual and physical health. To be in good health is His will for us because it brings Him glory. In addition, we have better energy when we are healthy, and we can be available to carry out His purpose and plans for our lives.
If it is important to God, it should be important to us. We cannot go each day treating our bodies with no care when God desires that we should care for it. If our bodies are sick or injured, we are unable to live the vibrant life that God desires for us. Remember how bad you feel when you are sick? God doesn`t want that for you.
