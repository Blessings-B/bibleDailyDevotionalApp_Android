MAY 22nd

My Body; His Home
 'Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?' 1 Corinthians 6:19

Text: 1 Corinthians 6:12-20

God lives in you. You are like a mobile home for the power and Spirit of God. It is important that this home reflects the Person who lives in it. Have you ever seen a picture of the Buckingham Palace or MAYbe you`ve been there? That is where Queen Elizabeth of England lives. It is a royal dwelling. Imagine if the Queen lived in a hut, beside a muddy swamp. That isn`t royal, is it?
God desires that His new home be royal and representative of Him. It is our responsibility to take care of this home. God wants you to feed your body right and treat it right. He wants when people see you they will see a temple fit for a King.  If you know putting certain things into your body will harm it, damage it or make it sick, whether it is the food you put into it, the things you watch that goes into your spirit or even your thoughts, then put them aside.

FURTHER STUDY: Ephesians 2:10
PRAYER: Lord help me to honour my body as you have honoured it by making it Your temple, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: What you cannot bring to the King`s (God`s) palace, do not put in your body.
