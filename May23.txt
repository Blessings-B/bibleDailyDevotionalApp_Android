MAY 23rd

Your Life Is God`s Witness
'But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria,                                                              and to the ends of the earth'. Acts 1:8

Text: Acts 1:1-8

A witness is one who gives evidence of something. God desires that our lives should give evidence of His nature, His love, and His power. When people encounter you, a message is passed before you even say a word. Part of being His witness is in the choices you make. Do you feed your body with healthy food options or junk food, drugs and alcohol? Do you feed your spirit with uplifting, inspiring material or negative, demeaning and depressing material?
When you neglect your spiritual or physical health, you are killing your spirit and body slowly. Jesus came to give us abundant life. God is saddened when we hurt ourselves by neglecting our health and many lives have been cut short because of this.

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 5:16; 1 Corinthians 3:16-17
PRAYER: Lord, let the choices I make for my body and my spirit reflect Your nature and Your goodness, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: If unbelievers were to emulate how you took care of your health, what would they learn?
