MAY 24th

Healthy Eating
But Daniel resolved not to defileÂ himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way. Daniel 1:8

Text: Daniel 1:3-8

Wrong food choices can make you sick! In today`s text, Daniel decided not to defile himself with the food from the king`s table. This was because the food had been prepared based on Babylonian rites and included certain food types which Jews were not allowed by God to eat.
In Genesis 1:29-30 and Genesis 9:3, God gave man as his food, everything that lives and moves, in addition to green plants. However, under the law of Moses, He makes a distinction between the clean and unclean animals. This is because there are health consequences of eating certain types of food and God wants to keep us from these negative consequences. 
Today a lot of the foods we eat are processed junk and chemical laden foods, which clog arteries and cause diseases. Choose foods that nourish your body and cook these foods in healthy ways. God cares about your health, and you should too!

FURTHER STUDY: Isaiah 55:2; 1 Corinthians 10:31
PRAYER: Lord, help me to choose foods that are healthy to nourish my body, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Fill half your plate with vegetables at each meal.
