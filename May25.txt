Exercise
 'For physical training is of some value....'. 1 Timothy 4:8

Text: 1 Timothy 4:6-15

Centuries ago, before the invention of cars, bicycles etc., people would often either ride horses and donkeys or walk long distances to get to their destination. Walking is great exercise. In modern times, there are various inventions e.g. cars, scooters, elevators, escalators etc.  which do not encourage much physical exercise. But physical exercise is important for good health.
When we don`t move, our muscles wean and become less disciplined. Your body reflects the lifestyle you choose and it reflects your health. Today, choose an activity you enjoy. It could be walking, skipping, swimming, dancing, netball, basketball, or even training in the gym. Commit to being regular with this activity. Not only would your health improve, but you`ll also learn to be more disciplined.

FURTHER STUDY: Philippians 4:13
PRAYER: Lord teach me to be disciplined with my exercise plan, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Design an exercise plan for yourself. You can get a friend to be a buddy on your plan.
