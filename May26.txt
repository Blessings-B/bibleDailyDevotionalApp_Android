MAY 26th

The Health of Your Mind
A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.
Proverbs 17:22

Text: Proverbs 17:1-28

Many people suffer because of the things they have let into their minds. Depression, anxiety disorders, personality disorders etc.  are actual medical conditions. As a young girl who had the habit of overthinking issues and sometimes obsessing about them, I fell into bouts of extreme sadness because I felt misunderstood and isolated. Thank God for Jesus and the friends He sent me who helped me overcome this.
We all need to guard our hearts and constantly assess the state of our mind to identify when we MAY be slipping into dark or unhealthy thoughts.  Speak to someone you trust about it.  You have the power to turn your thoughts from things that are not praiseworthy or helpful to positive, uplifting thoughts. 
Finally, be sensitive to other people who MAY be battling an unhealthy thought life. Reach out to them, encourage them with the Word of God and prayer and help the person find help.

PRAYER: Dear Lord, please teach me to oversee all the activities that happen in my mind. Let my mind be healthy, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Your emotions reflect the state of your mind. Focus on God`s promises. He has given you a SOUND MIND.
