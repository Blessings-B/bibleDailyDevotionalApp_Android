MAY 28th

Medium of Exchange
For wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter... Ecclesiastes 7:12a

Text: 2 Kings 5:19-27

Man used to trade by barter during the Stone Age. This meant that goods and services are exchanged for required goods or services. With civilization creeping in, this style of trading gave rise to cowries being used to obtain goods and services. Advancement in technology has brought us to the place where money as we know it, is used as a means of exchange.
Take a few minutes, reach into your purse for any naira note, preferably, the highest denomination available, take a hard look at it and call it a mere medium of exchange. That is what and all it is! So do not attach more importance to it. The catch, however, is what you are exchanging it with. You are meant to exchange it with what would promote you and ultimately the Kingdom of God for it is a shelter. Do not be like Gehazi who chose to exchange his for evil by choosing a path of destruction thereby exposing himself to harm.  The choice is yours; choose wisely.

FURTHER STUDY: Genesis 47:14-20; 2 Corinthians 8:9; John 2:14-16
PRAYER: Lord, money was created by man as a means of exchange. MAY I exchange it for worthwhile things in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: See money as a necessary piece of paper to assist in achieving your goals.
