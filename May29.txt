MAY 29th

Only A Caretaker
`The silver is mine and the gold is mine,` declares the Lord Almighty.                    Haggai 2:8

Text: Matthew 25:14-18

Have you ever been put in charge of the house, watching over your younger siblings until your parents or guardian return? Did you start to act as though it was really your own house and the kids your children? I am sure your mother has sent you to buy things for her. Did you get to the shops and buy what you wanted? I am sure the answer is a big NO. You followed her list because you understood that the money was not yours and you were only sent on an errand.
Any monies that come into our hands are not ours, even if we earned it; they belong to God and He only gave us an opportunity to run errands for Him even though it would impact positively in our lives. We should feel highly honoured to be entrusted by God and so carry out our responsibility with dignity and all sense of seriousness. 

FURTHER STUDY: 2 Kings 12:15; Proverbs 17:16; Matthew 24:45-51
PRAYER: Lord, thank you for making me worthy of such responsibility. MAY I be a faithful caretaker in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Handle any money that comes into your hands with a high sense of responsibility.
