Have A 'Me' Retreat
Yes, my soul, find rest in God; my hope comes from him.
Psalm 62:5

Text: Psalm 62:1-12

I recently asked my preteen daughter what she likes to do to relax and she gave me a list of 5 activities. Some had to be done alone e.g. reading story books and watching TV, while others needed an occasional partner or two, swimming and hanging out with friends. I considered these answers and realized that to have some sanity in your life you need to have a balance of time with others and time alone.
So, let`s take a moment to think ... Are all the things you like to do dependent on someone else being involved? If the answer is yes, then you need to begin to find ways to enjoy your life even when you are alone. Having good friends is a blessing. However, you need to be alone sometimes and still love those moments because they help to make you an even better friend and not a clingy needy one.

PRAYER: Lord Jesus, you often spent time on your own away from your disciples, sometimes to pray. Help me Lord to discover the joys of quality time spent on my own, in your name I pray Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Make a list of things you could do, if you had the whole day off to spend on your own.
