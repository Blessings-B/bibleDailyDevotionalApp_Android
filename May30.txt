MAY 30th

Principle of Seed
She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy.      Proverbs 31:20

Text: 2 Corinthians 9: 10-13

It is necessary at this point of your life to understand that there are two parts to any money that gets into your hands; one of which is the seed part. We all know what we should do with seeds; we plant them! It is only a foolish farmer that eats his seeds because when the time of harvest arrives, he will have nothing since he did not plant his seeds. A river that does not let out its waters will become stagnant and unhealthy. So also, a man that does not let out his own waters through acts of service will become unhealthy and experience stagnancy in life.
There are opportunities every day to do an act of love; to bring a smile; to lift a burden; to plant a seed. Specific seeds include tithes and offerings. God expects you to pay one-tenth of your allowance or profit if in business. He also expects that you will eagerly be part of His Kingdom builders financially and not close your arms to the ones who lack.

PRAYER: Lord MAY I open my heart and my arms and plant seeds in the lives of men as opportunities come, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Make sure you do not spend all monies on you and your needs; give out some.
