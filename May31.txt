Principle of Bread
Of what use is money in the hand of a fool, since he has no desire to get wisdom?
Proverbs 17:16

Text: 2 Corinthians 9:10-13

When God blesses us in terms of money, there are two sides of the coin- the seed and the bread. The bread is to be spent on your needs and this is where budgeting comes in very handy. A lot of us spend money on the go instead of sitting down under God`s leadership to map out how to effectively utilize the resources available. Bread is meant to give strength and sustain life; therefore, the bread portion God brings your way is able to sufficiently give strength and sustain life.
One advice would be to have budget heads which are calculated in percentages and drawn down as funds are used. This means that you could possibly have money but not have the money to fund a need. This requires wisdom, discipline and yielding to the Holy Spirit`s dictates but the dividends are numerous.

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 14:17-21; Numbers 3:51; Isaiah 55:2
PRAYER: Lord, again, it is clear to me that you have given me all I need if only I would handle it judiciously. Grant me the wisdom I need in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Let God guide your spending.
