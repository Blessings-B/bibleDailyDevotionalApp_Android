Health Really Is Wealth
...you were bought at a price. Therefore, honor God with your bodies.
 1 Corinthians 6:20

Text: 1 Corinthians 6:18-20

An amazing fact about the human body is that it was created to function like a well-oiled engine. With the right combination of food, exercise physical and spiritual well-being we should have no reason to feel down or ill. Ever wonder how the guys in the bible seemed to live so long, well they didn`t eat their meals out of a can or a box or plastic wrapper. They also did quite a bit of walking since there were no cars and planes at the time.
Now as I point at you I have four fingers pointing back at me, I also need to keep a close eye on making the right choices about my body. When I get a beautiful gift, I polish it, place it in a safe place, keep it clean etc. We need to treat our bodies as the living temple that we are.  

FURTHER STUDY: Romans 12
PRAYER: Dear Lord, help me to glorify you in my thoughts, words, and actions in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Examine your meals and be sure 80% of it came from the ground and not a can. Get that body moving for exercise.
