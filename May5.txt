On Your Mark...Get Set...Go for It
'I can do all this through him who gives me strength.'
Philippians 4:13

Text: Philippians 4:10-13

One of the benefits of taking time out for yourself is that it helps you think long and hard about what you would like to be or do as you get older or during the holiday or on your next trip to grandma`s. Pretty much anything that lies in your future.
Let`s try taking some steps towards planning purposefully for that future you see in your mind`s eye. This is called goal setting. 
First, write the goal. Next comes the actions needed to accomplish the goal and finally implementing the plan. For example, to go to grandma`s I have to first find out what day she and my parents would be available. The action point would be to call grandma and then talk to mum and dad. Do you get where I`m going? It`s a great way to achieve both big projects and little things like Granny visits. 
On your mark is the thought, get set is the writing, while Go for it are the calls, other actions taken and the final outcome. Hurry!!! Success is sweet!!!
