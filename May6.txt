MAY 6th

Hello Josephine!!!
'A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream. And as he interpreted to us, so it came about. I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.' Genesis 41:12-13.

Text:  Genesis 41:1-14.

Another amazing thing that happens during our alone time is we dream. Call it a daydream or some will say it`s fantasizing but our text today says differently. Joseph was a dreamer, though he wasn`t blessed with the right people to share his dreams with. It didn`t make him shut up about his dreams or his gift of interpretation of dreams. He did what he knew was right in God`s eyes and kept getting in trouble for it but one day, literally overnight, his story changed. He became the 2nd most important man in Egypt after Pharaoh. No one could have a meal without his approval.
That`s what God can do if you trust him with your hopes and dreams.

FURTHER STUDY: Genesis 37 & 38
PRAYER: Thank you, Father, for giving me a hope and future in Christ Jesus.  
TIP OF THE DAY: Dream and never stop dreaming, Josephine.
