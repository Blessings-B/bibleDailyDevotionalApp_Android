The Value of Friendship
If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls                              and has no one to help them up. Ecclesiastes 4:10

Text: Ecclesiastes 4:9-12

Have you ever embarked on a journey alone before? Compare the experience with when you embarked on the same journey with a companion. The distance seems shorter and the experience better. God created us to be social creatures, that means we relate to others and have others relate to us.
In the journey of life and the Christian race, we need friends that can lift us up when we are down, friends we can share our life experiences with. Jesus Himself had close friends that He shared deep experiences with. Mary, Martha, and Lazarus were all friends of Jesus whom He loved. If Jesus needed friends, so do we. Proverbs 18:24 says `A true friend sticks closer than a brother.` A friend stands by you in the hard times and good times, rejoices with your successes and helps you in this journey called life. 

FURTHER STUDY: Luke 8:51-52; Mark 9:2-3; John 11:3-5
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, thank you for the friends you have placed on my way on this journey called life, in your name I pray, Amen!
TIP OF THE DAY: Who are your friends?
