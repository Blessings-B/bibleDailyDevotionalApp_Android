Can I Be Trusted?
Many claim to have unfailing love, but a faithful person who can find?                                  Proverbs 20:6

Text: Proverbs 18:24

Have you had struggles in building and maintaining friendship in the past? Are there friendships you regret losing? Before you start blaming the other party, hold on and think about the role you played. Can you boldly say you put in your best?
One of the keys to long-lasting, successful relationships is being a trusted friend. Trustworthy means to be reliable, dependable and honest. Think of the following questions carefully and be sincere to yourself as you answer them. Can my friends trust me to be honest and truthful at all times, even when it MAY hurt? Can I be counted upon to be there when I say I will? Do I stand up for my friends especially when they cannot stand up for themselves? Am I loyal to my friends? Can I keep a secret or do I spill the secrets of my friends or gossip about them? Am I genuinely supportive and happy when my friends are succeeding? Am I supportive of my friends when they are faced with life`s challenges?
God is trustworthy and we, His children must follow His footsteps.
