Choosing the Right Friends
Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm.                             Proverbs 13:20

Text: 1 Kings 12:1-11

Friends are one of the greatest influences we have in our lives. The Bible teaches us in 1 Corinthians 15:33 that when we associate with the wrong people, our character is corrupted. Friendship should be deliberate and by choice not of convenience and should be done bearing your future in mind. Your friends should share your values and beliefs. As Proverbs 13:20 says if you want to be wise, you walk with the wise. If you value God, your friends should be people who value God.
Proverbs 27:17 says iron sharpens iron, the people whom you choose as friends should be people who would improve you, challenge you, encourage you when you are down, tell you when you are wrong. Do your friends meet these criteria? If not, it`s time to go friend- shopping with these principles in mind. Ask the Holy Spirit to guide you.
