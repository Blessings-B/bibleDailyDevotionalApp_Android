You were Formed

`For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother`s womb.
Psalm 139:13

Text: Psalm 139:13-14.

As a teenager, I was a bit self-conscious until I understood that God made me. He made my legs exactly as it is, and I still think that they are a bit funny looking. He made my fingernails and I like them very much. When I understood that I was made by a very good creator, I began to appreciate myself better.
He designed you - your skin tone, your hair, ears and the parts of your body that you cannot see. The same God who made the lovely peacock and the scented rose, the shiny stars and the dog`s nose made you. 
He knit all of you together intentionally and then put His signature on you. That is why no two thumbprints are alike. There are about 7.5 billion people on earth and no two thumbprints are alike.  What a God!

FURTHER STUDY: Isaiah 49:5; Genesis 1:26-27
PRAYER: Thank you Lord because you made me just the way I am, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Allow yourself to be confident about how you look.
