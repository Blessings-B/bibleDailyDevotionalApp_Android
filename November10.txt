About Peer Pressure

Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor
stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers.
Psalms 1:1 (KJV)

Text: Galatians 1:1-10

What does the bible say about Peer pressure? Galatians 1:10 for am I now seeking the approval of man or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.  Understand that pleasing man here does not refer to doing your best to live a life that brings joy to others. We definitely should work towards that but make sure that God is glorified in your actions.
It`s quite simple, look at the people you allow yourself to be influenced by, are they people whose lives please God? One thing is certain, if they seek to please God, they will not ask you to do anything that will not give God glory. When you`re being pressurized to do something ask yourself, what I am being asked to do, does it glorify God? It MAY be a good idea but is it a God idea? With the help of the Holy Spirit, you can differentiate between the two.

FURTHER STUDY: Acts 5:29
PRAYER: Lord, help me to seek to please you only and live my life for you, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Find a Christian mentor or coach, someone you are accountable to.
