Looks Like a Dog, Barks Like a Dog

Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers...' Philippians 3:2 (NASB)

Text: 2 Samuel 13:1-21

Sexual predators choose places where they can exercise power over their victims. In today`s text, Tamar was invited to her brother`s room to prepare food. Food is prepared in the kitchen not the bedroom and this was the first sign that something wasn`t right. Tamar probably felt nothing could go wrong in her palace home.
We have been blessed by God with an `intuitive feeling`. In dangerous situations, it`s that uneasy feeling (i.e. the Holy Spirit warning you) that tells you something is not right.  Don`t stop to analyze the feeling, just run! It could save you from being a victim of sexual molestation.
As someone who was molested sexually as a teenager, I will show you over the next few days how God brought me through it and turned me from victim to victor. 

FURTHER STUDY: Colossians 2:8; Titus 1:10-11  
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, teach me to recognize the gentle prodding and warnings of Holy Spirit. Amen
TIP OF THE DAY: Trust your instincts!
