He`s My Brother!

'By their fruit, you will recognize them.....Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit,                                but a bad tree bears bad fruit.  Matthew 7:16

Text: 2 Samuel 13:1-21

Tamar probably knew something was wrong but reasoned it away by saying `he`s my brother`. Sexual predators are usually familiar faces, people we trust. As Christians, we tend to be too trusting and let our guards down, forgetting that the Bible says we are like sheep in the midst of wolves.
At 17, I was raped by two `brothers in the Lord`. Like Tamar, I felt safe with them because they were Christians. I ignored the promptings of the Holy Spirit and went to help my `Christian brothers` clean up their uncle`s house. Even in Church, we have sexual predators too, wolves in sheep clothing! 

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 7:15-23; 2 Corinthians 11:14-15
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, please help me discern the sheep from the wolf; to always be sensitive to your Spirit, who reveals the intents of men`s hearts.  Amen
TIP OF THE DAY: Be aware of your environment. Do not allow yourself to be isolated!
