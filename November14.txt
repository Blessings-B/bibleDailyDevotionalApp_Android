Wisdom Is Essential

'I am sending you out like sheep among wolves.Therefore, be as shrewd as snakes                                  and as innocent as doves.' Matthew 10:16

Text: Matthew 10:1-20

Jesus uses the analogy of these four animals to show us what to expect in the world as Christians and what qualities we need; the meekness of sheep against the ferocity of wolves, the shrewd wisdom (discernment, sharpness, smartness, astuteness) of serpents, together with the innocent wisdom of doves.
Serpents are discerning, with keen eyesight. They need these qualities to catch prey and evade predators. A dove, which is a symbol also, used to represent the Holy Spirit, is innocent and gentle. In a world filled with potential wolves, Jesus wants you to acquire the pure wisdom of the Holy Spirit, through prayer and study of the Word. This wisdom is discerning and enables you to evade sexual predators who desire to prey on your innocence.
