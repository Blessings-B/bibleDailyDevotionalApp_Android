The Guilt Trip

'You know how troubled I am; you have kept a record of my tears'.                                              Psalm 56:8 (GNT)

Text: 2 Samuel 13:11-13

In Bible times and unfortunately in modern times, a woman who is raped lives in shame even though it`s not her fault. The victim is blamed for dressing provocatively, being in the wrong place etc. The Bible requires us to act and dress decently. However, failure to do so does not justify sexual molestation.
If you have been a victim, do not let anyone put the blame on you, neither should you blame yourself. I went through a long period of shame, pain, guilt, and what-ifs. I raged against God and was angry with Him for not `saving` me. 
We don`t worship an indifferent God! He feels our pain, weeps with us and can take our frustration. Mary and Martha vented, and so can we.

PRAYER: Lord, please wrap your hand of love around my broken body and bruised spirit. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Give those negative feelings to God and don`t take them back!
