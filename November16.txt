Weeping MAY Endure for A Night

'But for you who revere my name,the sun of righteousness
will rise with healing in its rays'. Malachi 4:2

Text: Malachi 4:1-3

Sexual molestation is a humiliating experience! The abuser reduces the victim to an object, dehumanizing them and taking away their dignity, just like Amnon did to Tamar, despising her after he had abused her.  Tamar was damaged goods, no one would want her and she didn`t like herself afterwards.
After I was raped, I didn`t like myself, became depressed and tried to commit suicide. Sharing my ordeal with trusted brethren who loved me and supported me helped my recovery. The devil wants to isolate you so he can destroy you. Don`t let him! Depression and suicidal thoughts thrive in secrecy. Let God`s love in through the Word and the support of mature believers. You will be surprised at what God can do in you. 

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 147:3; Isaiah 41:10; Romans 8:37-39
PRAYER: Lord, help me! Deliver me from the darkness and teach me to love myself again even as you love me, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Tell yourself daily 'I am fearfully and wonderfully made!'
