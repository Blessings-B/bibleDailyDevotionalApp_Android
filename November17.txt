Life`s Not Fair

'...so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort                                                          we ourselves receive from God' 2 Corinthians 1:4

Text: 2 Corinthians 1:3-6

Why did Jesus come too late to keep Lazarus from dying? Why did Mary and Martha have to experience grief? Why does a Christian get sexually molested? Why do we suffer? Why?
While we MAY not receive all the answers we want, we know Jesus weeps with us! He knows our pain. God comforts us in our troubles in order that we MAY encourage others with the same comfort we ourselves received.
Our sufferings do not equip us to comfort others but the experience of suffering AND BEING COMFORTED BY GOD does! Whatever we pass through in life is always for a purpose and we trust God that it will work out for our good. So, though life MAY not have been fair, God is still good!

FURTHER STUDY: Isaiah 53:4-6; Romans 8:28
PRAYER: Lord, help me trust you, to see your love and feel your presence even in my pain, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Count your blessings and trust in God.
