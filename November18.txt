Let Go, Let God
'....Then he fell on his knees and cried out, 'Lord, do not hold this sin against them.'                         Acts 7:60

Text: Acts 7:54-60

When you have been sexually molested, letting go of the hurt, pain, anger, hate, bitterness, humiliation, suicidal and murderous thoughts is not easy. I know because I struggled too! You need to forgive the abuser (and yourself) and release them from your heart, in order to complete the healing process.  Let God`s Word fill your heart with light and accept His love flowing from other believers.
God`s ways are not our ways. He loves you too much to allow you destroy yourself with all these negative emotions. When you let go and let God, He helps you forgive, takes the hurt and pain away and steps in to right the wrong done to you.    

FURTHER STUDY: Colossians 1:13-14; 1 Corinthians 13:4-6; 1 Corinthians 10:13
PRAYER: Lord, give me the mind of Christ who died for me.  Help me forgive because Christ also died for my abuser in your name I pray, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Meditate on Philippians 4:13 - 'I can do all things through Christ' (including forgiving).
