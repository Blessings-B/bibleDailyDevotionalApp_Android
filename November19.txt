A Man of The People/A Man of God

But now, forgive their sin - but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written. Exodus 32:32

Text: Exodus32:9-14

Moses understood that his place as a leader was to seek the good of his people. God could have destroyed the Israelites and made Moses into a great nation but Moses stood in the gap. He not only stood in the gap, he offered to take the place of the people and have his name blotted out instead. Leadership is not about you. It`s about the people.
There is no leader if there are no people to lead. A leader`s focus should be his people at all times.

FURTHER STUDY: Acts 20:28-37; 1 Peter 5:1-4
PRAYER: Lord by making us the head and not the tail, a light and a salt, you have made us leaders in our environments. Help us to learn how to do this your way, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Which one person in a leadership position do you or have you ever admired? What makes that person stand out for you?
