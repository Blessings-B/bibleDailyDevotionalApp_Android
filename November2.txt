You are Perfect

`I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.`
Psalm 139:14

Text: Psalm 139:13-14.

You are perfect just the way you are.
Yes, you are and even the Lord will tell you that. His works are wonderful including you. You are the appropriate height - neither too tall nor too short. Your face is the right shape - whether it is oval, round or square. Whatever it is that is making you feel insecure about your looks, look at it again and know that God made it that way. 
Even if a part of your body has been marred, still know that you are beautiful. Do not let another person who is also made, be the authority on what beauty is.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Samuel 16:7; Matthew 10:29-31
PRAYER: Thank you Lord that you have designed me in the most wonderful and beautiful way. Open my eyes to see this in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Be yourself - just add a little bit of grooming and a smile.
