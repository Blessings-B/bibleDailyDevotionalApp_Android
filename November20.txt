Responsibility or Privilege?

A good leader motivates, doesn`t mislead, doesn`t exploit.                                  Proverbs 16:10 (MSG)

Text: Proverbs 16:10-19(MSG)

Leadership, as we have often seen it, has become a means for people to get power and use it for themselves. But is that what leadership is about?
Leadership is both a responsibility and a privilege. It is a responsibility to God, a responsibility to those who have gone before you, to hold up or build the right legacy, and a responsibility to those coming behind you. It is a privilege because those in positions of honour should be worthy of honour. It is also a privilege to be thought worthy and trusted with such a responsibility.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Timothy 4:11-16; 2 Corinthians 12:14-15
PRAYER: Give me the grace Lord not to fail in my responsibilities in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Thank God for the opportunity given you to serve as a leader.
