Earned Not Demanded

But he refused to drink it; instead he poured it out to the Lord.                                                          1 Chronicles 11:18b

Text: 1 Chronicles 11:16-19.

David could have commanded his men to get him water from the well, if he was proud and had the notion that all they existed to do was serve him. However, because he had been a true leader, one who would and did go out of his way for the good of his people, his men were more than willing to risk their lives for him without being asked.
Respect as a leader should be earned not demanded.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Samuel 30:3-25; Romans 13:7
