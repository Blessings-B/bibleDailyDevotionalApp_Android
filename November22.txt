Servant Leadership

I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.                                          John 13:15

Text: John 13:1-17

Think about it, Jesus and his disciples walked to get to wherever they were going. So, the disciples` feet must have been very dirty. Historians tell us that in those days part of how you said welcome to a visitor especially a respected one, was to give him water to wash his feet. This was often done by the servants in the house. Yet the King of kings and Lord of lords donned the robes of a servant and bent to wash not just one but 12 pairs of very dirty feet.
As a leader, nothing should be too demeaning for us to do to reach out to or help those we lead (as long as it is not a sin). From sitting with our juniors to befriending the lonely or outcast, to going without a meal so that they can eat. Each of you should look not only to your own interests (Philippians 2:3)-this is the mark of a Christian, more so the mark of a Christian leader. 

FURTHER STUDY: Luke 22:24-26; Matthew 20:26-28.
PRAYER: Lord, help me be more like you, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Think of unconventional ways you can be of service to someone today.
