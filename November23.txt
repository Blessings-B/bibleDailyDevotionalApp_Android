Qualities of A Leader

Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task.                              1 Timothy 3:1

Text: 1 Timothy 3:1-10

Our text lists out rather stringent qualifications for a leader. Why is this so? A leader has loads of responsibilities and influence. A leader can also be called a shepherd. He clothes, feeds, protects and cares for those under him.
The responsibilities of a leader are also akin to those of a mother, father, and a mentor. A leader sees the potential in you and draws it out. Helps you become the best you can be. Being a leader also means a lot of people look up to you. Your life ceases to be just your concern but affects other people. This means you have to be more careful how you live. Leadership is a lot of work. Are you ready for it?

FURTHER STUDY: Ezekiel 33:1-6; 34:1-12.
PRAYER: Give us leaders with your heart Lord and let me be one, in Jesus name I pray, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Stop and evaluate. Make a checklist of the qualities of a leader. How have you fared?
