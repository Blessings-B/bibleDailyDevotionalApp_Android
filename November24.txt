Following

Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you. Hebrews 13:17

Text: Exodus 24:13; Numbers 27:15-23

It`s easy to say, `If I was the one in charge I would do this and do that. If I were the prefect, the president, governor, etc.` But how good a follower have you been?
Truth is if following is beneath you then leadership is above you. Before Joshua was appointed to lead Israel, he followed and served Moses and the Lord faithfully. In learning to follow he learnt and saw firsthand the ways of God. 

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 4:19-20; Mark 3:13-14; 1 Corinthians 11:1
PRAYER: Lord, I repent of every time I have been a stumbling block to my leaders.
TIP OF THE DAY: Say a prayer for someone in a position of leadership over you today.
