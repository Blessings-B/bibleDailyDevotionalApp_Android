The Good Shepherd

I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.                   John 10:11

Text: John 10:11-15

Jesus is the chief shepherd of our souls. He is the good shepherd. And He showed us the way by laying down His life for us. His love for us led to His death on the cross because it is not His desire that anyone should perish.
Do you know him? If you do not, this is as good a time as any to accept His sacrifice on your behalf and make Him Lord and Saviour. 

FURTHER STUDY: John 3:16-18; 2 Corinthians 5:14-21
PRAYER: Heavenly Father, I come to you, I accept that I am a sinner. I accept that on my own I would never be able to make it back to you. Lord, I accept the sacrifice Jesus made on my behalf. And today I say Jesus come into my heart; I accept you as personal Lord and Saviour, come and reign in my life. Remove my name from the book of death and place it in the book of life in Jesus name I pray, Amen!
TIP OF THE DAY: Take the best decision of your life. Make Jesus the Lord of your life.
