Why Is Serving God Important?

'Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God`s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God-this is your spiritual act of worship.'
Romans 12:1

Text: 	1 Peter 4:10-11

A story is told of a young boy who was about to be crushed by a car as he dashed into the street to pick his runaway ball. He literally saw his death but suddenly he was on the sidewalk with nothing but a bruise. What happened? A woman had pushed him out of harm`s way and died in his place. The boy decided he would find out who the woman was and live his life to honour her. This is what Christ did for us. Took our death that we might live. Having given His all for us, can we give Him less?
Ephesians 2:10 tells us that there are works God prepared in advance for us to do. This speaks about purpose. Serving God does not only honour God but gives purpose to our existence. It is why we are here. To do the good works God prepared in advance for us to do.
