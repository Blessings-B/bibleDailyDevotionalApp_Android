The Act of Service

`But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God
must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of
them that diligently seek him. Hebrews 11:6(KJV)

Text: Romans 12:3-8

There is only one company that pays in this time and in eternity. There is also one company that even in an economic recession is constantly declaring that `laborers` are few and wants to employ the services of as many as it can. This company has no downtime or redundancy period and it is the highest rewarder of service.
Our text tells us that God has given each one of us various gifts and these gifts are to be used in His service. We are part of the Kingdom of Heaven and we are to do our part to make His will be done on earth as it is done in heaven. Our service to God must be deliberate that means it doesn`t just happen. We must find out our gifts and use it to bring glory to His name.

FURTHER STUDY: Exodus 23:25-33; Mark 10:29-30; Luke 10:2
PRAYER: Holy Spirit help me express my love to the Father through my acts of service and obedience to His words.
