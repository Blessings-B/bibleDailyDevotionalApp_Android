The Whole of Creation

For the creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed
Romans 8:19

Text: 	Matthew 5:14-16

Service to God is making sure that the burden on God is reduced. In Matthew West`s song Do something, he writes of noticing all the problems and injustice around in the world. Disturbed by all he saw, He asked God, `why don`t you do something about this?` and God answered, `I did, I created you.`
Romans 8 tells us that the whole of creation awaits our manifestation as the sons of God. God`s answer to the problems in the world is you and I. Service to God does not end in the church building or church family. Jesus said we are the light of the whole world. We are to go out there and cause changes and provide solutions. In our schools, in our families, in our neighbourhood and our nation. Answers to the problems of poverty and disease, answers to the problems of injustice and inequity. God has given us what it takes.

PRAYER: Father help me not to shrink back from being the light of hope that you have called me to be in this dark world, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Fetch water for an old woman living alone, volunteer at an orphanage. Let the world see Heaven in you.
