Divine Protection & Covering

`Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of
destruction when it cometh. At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh:
neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. Job 5:21-22(KJV)

Text: Isaiah 54:17

The greatest defense against death is purpose. A purpose filled life is that life that knows and understands the problem that she is here on earth to be a solution to and goes about her daily life fulfilling that purpose.
An easy way to secure divine protection is by living in your purpose on earth. Such a person is valuable to the kingdom of God. God pulls the resources from above to protect and shield the person so that no harm comes to her. We have testimonies of God`s generals who were living and fulfilling God`s purpose for them, saved from plane and automobile crashes.  

FURTHER STUDY: Deuteronomy 28:7
PRAYER: Holy Spirit help me identify my purpose on earth and start living in it as that is when I truly start living. Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Identify those areas or things in which you find pleasure doing even if you are not appreciated or paid for doing them because it is in those things we often find our purpose.
