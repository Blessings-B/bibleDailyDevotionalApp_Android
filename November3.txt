Compare and Contrast

`When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.` 2 Corinthians 10:12b

Text: 2 Corinthians 10:12.

God expects you to be you - not anybody else.
He gave you your particular set of gifts, abilities and looks so that you have all you need to do what you are meant to do. When we are busy looking at and comparing ourselves to other people, we are busy wasting the time we should have used to do what we should be doing. However, when we begin to truly appreciate who and how we are, we will be liberated to discover the talents within us and to do what we have been created for. 
Christ is the only perfect measure. Let us focus on the race set before us and run as well as we can through God`s help.

TIP OF THE DAY: Find out one thing that you are good at (you could ask one or two trusted family and friends) and aim to get better at it.
