Establishment of Our Seeds and Generation

That our sons MAY be as plants grown up in their youth: that our daughters MAY be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace: Psalm 144:12

Text: 	1 Kings 11:38.

One of God`s promises to His servants is fruitfulness and fulfilling the number of our days especially on our seeds. One of the things our service to God does is that He establishes our seeds and ensures our seeds take root and grows and bears fruits. Service to God ensures that our children are taken care of, protected, and established in their different spheres of life.
The individual that serves God and worships gets that mark of honor that distinguishes them from other people and the extra anointing which separates them and their household. When we`re working side by side with other people, a bond inevitably forms. This was part of God`s plan for how the church is supposed to work.

FURTHER STUDY: Deuteronomy 28:4, 11
PRAYER: Even as I serve you with all my heart, let the blessing of service be associated with me always in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Remain in service and be thankful as challenges come up because God is in your business as you are in His.
