Not a Snob

`...They said ...'where are you staying?'  'Come,' he replied, 'and you will see.' So...they spent that day with him...`
John 1:38b-39

Text: John 1:35-39.

Some people get their sense of worth from the calibre of people they relate to or get attention from - how rich, smart, popular, talented or respected they are. Sometimes, these `sought-after` people form exclusive clubs for people like them.
Not so with Jesus. He made everything, has numerous followers, can do amazing things and his name is famous on earth and beyond - yet He is not a snob. John`s disciples asked for His address and He invited them to His house and spent time with them. 
Even today, the Presence of Jesus is open to all sincere seekers. You can spend as much time as you want with the Lord and you are even allowed to boast that you know Him.  Your sense of worth should come from knowing Him yet this should humble you and make you not to snob people.  

FURTHER STUDY: John 6:37; Jeremiah 9:24
PRAYER: Lord, help me to respond daily to your invitation that I MAY know you better, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Talk to God simply - about the important and the mundane.
