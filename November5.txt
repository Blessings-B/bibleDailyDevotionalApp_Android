Peer Pressure

So, then brothers, stand firm and hold on to the traditions that you were taught by us,            either by our spoken word or by our letter...   2 Thessalonians 2:15

Text: Romans 12:1-2

What is peer pressure? As defined by Wikipedia peer pressure is A direct influence on people by peers or the effect on an individual who gets encouraged to follow their peers by changing their attitudes, values or behaviours to conform to those of the influencing group or individual. Another definition is the influence of your friends on your decisions. This means you allow others think for you and control your actions, which is just ridiculous if you think about it. For example, a young lady decides to get hooked up with a guy just because she doesn`t want to be the only girl without a boyfriend.
The Bible says in Romans 12:2 be not conformed to the pattern of this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you MAY prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. That scripture tells us that the only influence we should submit to is the influence of the Word of God.

PRAYER: Father help me to hold on to your word and to live only by your words, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Think about your actions, what are the strongest influences on your decisions?
