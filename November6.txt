Overcoming Peer Pressure

Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm.                                Proverbs 13:20

Text: Proverbs 1:10-19

What does it mean to entice? The Merriam Webster dictionary defines the word entice as `to attract artfully by arousing hope or desire.` The word entice is synonymous with allure, bait, betray, decoy, lure, tempt, seduce. These words all imply drawing into danger, evil or difficulty by attracting and deceiving. That is the reason God says, `Do not consent` and that is not a suggestion, it is a command.
Young people and in fact everyone at some point in their life, will be faced with pressure to take some action or the other but it is important to remember that there is positive and negative pressure. Negative peer pressure leads you down the wrong path while positive peer pressure leads to encouragement and growth. We should not go along with our friends` suggestions unless it leads to godly growth. The Bible is our standard for living and the only approval we should seek is God`s approval.
