The Influence

Do not be misled: 'Bad company corrupts good character.'                                                                       1 Corinthians 15:33

Text: Job 2:1-10

Peer pressure is not limited to adolescents only. It influences boys, girls, adolescents, teenagers, full grown adults. Someone might be wondering but who are my peers? People you find yourself spending a lot of time with. They MAY be people you go to the same school with, people you work with, your Church folk, your neighbors and to be honest sometimes you can`t do away with them. Unless you want to keep jumping from school to school, job to job, they will always be around you. It becomes important therefore to learn to handle this pressure. 
The common pressures young people face include the pressure to drink alcohol, experiment with drugs, pre-marital sex, disobedience to parents and to God in the name of being independent. We are however from a kingdom that lives by a different code of conduct.
