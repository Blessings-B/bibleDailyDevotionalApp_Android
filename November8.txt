Why Give In?

Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.                                                                                        Galatians 1:10

Text: Mark 6:17-29

Why do people give in to pressure? Most often it`s insecurity and a desire to be accepted. We want to fit in, we don`t want to be left out, we don`t want to be mocked and sometimes we say yes because we just want to try something new.  It is easy to give in if we have a low self-esteem, not knowing who we are or what we are worth. People also going through problems such as divorce, alcoholism, unemployment are often vulnerable. Well, no matter what it is, we can overcome peer pressure. 
Like a wise man once said, `Don`t let your background cause you to put your back on the ground`. The key is knowing who you are. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, that`s what the bible says. So, get into the Word, because everything you need to know about yourself is in the Word. 

FURTHER STUDY: James 1:13-15
PRAYER: In Jesus name, Father even as I meditate on your word, open my eyes to see in myself what you see in me, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Take a moment to consider your values, beliefs and attitude, are they in line with the word of God?
