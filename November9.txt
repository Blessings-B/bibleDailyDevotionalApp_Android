Is Peer Pressure Good or Bad?

A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart.                                                                                                                                                                                                   For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. Luke 6:45

Text: Psalms 122:1-4

Is peer pressure a good or bad thing? The answer is yes and no, it depends on what you do with it. Peer pressure can be a good thing if what you`re being asked to do will bring positive results, that is what we term `positive peer pressure`. Peer pressure is negative if taking that action will bring about negative consequences. For example, if saying yes to that Asoebi material will leave you broke before the month ends, yet you go ahead to buy the material because you don`t want to be left out. Or young men roped into betting and gambling, that`s one of the worst forms of addiction I have seen. 
Wisdom is profitable to direct. When asked to do something or even think about an action, take a moment to consider the consequences of your actions, both short term and long term. Keep these in mind as you make your decision. 

FURTHER STUDY: James 1:5
PRAYER: Father I ask for wisdom to make decisions that will give you glory, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: If you find yourself constantly taking wrong decisions, ask God to give you wisdom, He is more than willing to do that.
