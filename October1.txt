OCTOBER 1st

Developing the Right Value System
Make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm. Proverbs 4:26

Text: 2 Timothy 2:19-22

The main text gives a picture of how a vessel can determine its usefulness or value in a house. When a deliberate effort is made to have the right value system, you can be sure that you have attracted a high premium on yourself. In other words, you have made level and firm ways for yourself. A value system is your view, outlook, and definition of life. A few tips to set you on the right path are to
>Understand that you are nothing without God.
>Read to acquire knowledge and enhance your skills.
>Select good mentors; those you can positively learn from.
>Select right people, who fear and love God, as friends and companions.
>Make the Word of God your final authority.
>Pray about everything.
Remember that an eagle does not feed like a vulture.
