Don`t Go Along

`...My son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths.`
Proverbs 1:15

Text: Proverbs 1:10-15

Sometimes, to show bravado or that they are cool, people might dare others to do something that they ordinarily would not do. If the person refuses, they might be mocked for being weak or boring; they might be promised all sorts of goodies - all in the attempt to goad them into doing something wrong, dangerous or harmful.
Don`t go along with such people because they only ambush themselves and their ill-gotten gain takes away their lives.

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 1:16-19; Daniel 1:8, 12-15
PRAYER: Father I ask for the ability to say no to people who invite me to do violence - in any form, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Peer pressure is only good for doing things that will help you succeed in the present or future!
