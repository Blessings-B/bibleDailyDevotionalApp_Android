Be Wise and Harmless

`I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves` Matthew 10:16

Text: Matthew 10:1-26

A snake is not an easy prey but it is dangerous. A dove is peaceful but is a prey. Jesus asked his disciples to be shrewd (clever, discerning, not easily caught) like the snake but not dangerous and also to be innocent and harmless like a dove but not to be an easy prey. Jesus knew that the world can be dangerous.
Do you know any wolves? Do you sometimes feel like you are a sheep surrounded by wolves? Jesus is asking you to be shrewd but pure in heart. He will make a way for you. He always does.

FURTHER STUDY: James 1:5; Luke 16:8; Proverbs 4:7 
PRAYER: Lord, help me to be harmless and peaceful but also to be confident, assertive and shrewd. Give me the grace to stand up for myself against evil, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Research the snake and the dove - I doubt that your biology teacher will! Your findings might help you get out of or totally avoid sticky situations.
