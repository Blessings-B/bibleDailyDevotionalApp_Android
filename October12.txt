Don`t Be an Avenger

`... but leave room for God`s wrath, for it is written; 'It is mine to avenge; I will repay,' says the Lord.` Romans 12:19b

Text: Romans 12:19-21

It might seem rather foolish to repay evil with good however it depends on whose perspective you consider.  The world thinks that evil should be repaid with evil to teach the evildoers a lesson. This is foolish because it is like trying to use darkness to drive out darkness.
Everyone knows that only light can drive away darkness. Therefore God says `Turn on your light - use good to repay evil`. Besides, He alone has the right to avenge and He does!

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 94:1; Proverbs 24:17-18
PRAYER: Lord, I forgive those who have hurt me. Help me forgive them from my heart, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Do not gloat (even in your heart) when someone who has done you harm stumbles or else the Lord will see and disapprove and turn his wrath away from them.
