OCTOBER   13th

Pregnant Desire

 `...but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed`. James 1:14

Text: James 1:14-15

Have you ever said or heard someone say `You made me do this?` In the passage above, we learn that we cannot be tempted by something we have no interest in. For example, if we don`t like eggs, we are unlikely to be enticed by eggs, no matter how lovely the aroma is.
In the same way, violence happens when an evil desire for example of hurting someone else, is allowed to grow. When that desire is fed by giving it attention in our thoughts, it conceives and then it gives birth to the action (sin). If we repeat that sinful action, again and again, it leads to death - of our conscience, our joy in the Lord or some other valuable thing.

FURTHER STUDY: Hebrews 12:4; Galatians 5:19-21
PRAYER: Dear Jesus MAY the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable to you. Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Take responsibility for your actions by taking control over your thoughts.
