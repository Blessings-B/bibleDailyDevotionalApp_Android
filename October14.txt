Human Anger

`...because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires`.
James 1:20

Text: James 1:19-20

Think about this for two seconds - `why` is usually answered with `because`. When James in our key verse says `because...` he was answering a `why` - because human anger does not produce the righteousness of God. That`s why.
That`s why we should be eager to listen, wait before speaking and be slow to get angry. That`s why - because no matter how much we speak and get angry, it will not produce the righteousness that God desires. 
Sometimes, we need to know why we are doing something. If human anger is pointless, then it is pointless. God is slow to anger, you know. There are at least 6 passages of the scripture I know which use the phrase `slow to anger` in reference to God.

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 103:8; Joel 2:13; Proverbs 18:2-13
PRAYER: Father, teach me to be slow to anger like you, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Before you get angry, listen.
