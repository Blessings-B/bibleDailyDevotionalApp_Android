What is Discipline?

`No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however,
it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those
who have been trained by it.` Hebrews 12:11

Text: Hebrews 12:11-12; 1 Corinthians 9:27

The purpose of discipline is to train for maturity and correct behavior. This can mean acting against your feelings because you have a higher goal. Discipline also involves discarding hindrances including things that MAY be all right in and of themselves but don`t help as you grow towards godliness. In addition, discipline often entails managing your time in line with your goals. It is an ongoing process and not a quick fix. This means you can never say, 'I have arrived' in the school of discipline.
Discipline is something in which both God and you must be involved. You have a responsibility in the matter. It boils down to the question, `are you willing to pay the price`? If athletes put themselves through years of hard work and training to get a gold medal, shouldn`t we be willing to pay the price to be godly?

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 6:23; 25:28; 29:17.
PRAYER: Prepare me Lord for the journey of discipline ahead of me, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: If we are ever going to be disciplined, we must be prepared to pay the price.
