The Necessity of Discipline

`They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we MAY share in his holiness.` Hebrews 12:10

Text: Hebrews 12:4-12

The necessity of discipline is to deter destruction. A part of becoming successful is being disciplined. Governments, schools, and individuals need discipline to function successfully. This is expressed through skill, perseverance, tenacity, self-control, and resistance to temptations and distractions.
Discipline allows a person to act according to thoughts and not feelings and to sacrifice instant gratification in favour of long-term goals. Lack of discipline can cause failure, health issues, relationship problems and even death. Discipline helps a person to overcome addictions, negative habits, laziness and procrastination which can all lead to destruction now or in the future.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Corinthians 9:24-27; Philippians 3:12-14.
PRAYER: Dear Lord, don`t let me continue putting off until later what I can do today in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Discipline works best when it is self-imposed rather than externally imposed.
