The Means of Discipline

`For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.` Matthew 25: 29

Text: Matthew 25:14 30

One of God`s principles for advancement is the requirement to be diligent with what we have and where we are before He will advance us to bigger and better things. Being faithful requires self-discipline.
God knows that if you are not disciplined to take care of that which you have right now; material things, your body, family, job, ministry and so on, then you will not be ready for God to bring you more responsibility and influence in your life. Jesus illustrated this exact point in the parable of the three servants in the main text for today and He summed it up in verse 29. The 
surest means of attaining discipline is faithfulness.

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 13:4; 2 Timothy 4:7-8.
PRAYER: Please give me the motivation and willpower to be the best that I can be at all times in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: If you are faithful in little things, you will be qualified to handle bigger ones.
