Discipline in Sexuality
`...and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.`
2 Corinthians 10: 5b

Text: 2 Corinthians 10:5-6

The spiritual discipline of chastity is not just keeping the body pure from sexual sin, it`s also keeping the mind and heart pure. When we separate ourselves from sexual sin, we can clear our thoughts and actions so that we can focus on God and His plan for our lives.
We live in a society where sexuality is a part of almost everything. We have movies, TV, billboards, magazines, books and more all promoting sex outside the bounds of marriage. We face sexual temptation everywhere we go. Sometimes, even when we just don`t mean to, we MAY end up over our heads in a sexual situation. However, we can remain chaste by surrendering our thoughts and actions to God`s will and avoiding sexually charged situations, including movies and people.

FURTHER STUDY: Job 31:1; 1 Corinthians 6:18-20.
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, help me to flee from sexual sin and lust.
TIP OF THE DAY: Sex is about love, intimacy and marriage and not a mere self-indulgence of pleasure.
