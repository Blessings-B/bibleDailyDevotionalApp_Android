OCTOBER   19th

Discipline in Time
`making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.` Ephesians 5:16

Text: Ephesians 5:15-17

Every teen needs to be disciplined with time which is a very precious gift given to everyone to be spent for none of it can be stored. Each day, you receive 86,400 seconds. That MAY sound like a lot, but we all know they go by so quickly. Success in life will be dependent on what you do with them.
There are 112 hours in a week; the average teen spends 56 of those asleep and another 48 in school. That leaves 64 hours for cleaning up, chores and spare time. How much of that do you spend doing important things? Paul tells us in Ephesians 5:15-16 to walk not as the unwise but as wise men making the most of our time. He admonishes us to take advantage of every time available to us to be useful. Without discipline, opportunities are lost and time is squandered.

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 90:12; Colossians 4:5; Galatians 6:10.
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, teach me to number every second I spend every day that I MAY be more productive than I am today, in your name I pray, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: All the great things we want to accomplish tomorrow are impossible without the discipline of time today.
