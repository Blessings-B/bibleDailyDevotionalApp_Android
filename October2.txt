OCTOBER   2nd

Acceptable Service

All nations will be blessed through you Galatians 3:8b

Text: Romans 12:1-3

You stroll into a restaurant really hungry and ready to eat a lion. You sit at a table and a waiter appears to take your order. You place your order and relax with a magazine, awaiting your food. Seemingly in 5 minutes, the waiter walks in with your order and you praise him for his swift service. He places your plate carefully and you pick up your cutlery to eat. `What`s this!` you cry out. On your plate was eba and soup but you were expecting rice and plantain! The waiter served you in record time but his service was not acceptable to you.
We MAY think we are serving God but if we are engaged in what He hasn`t called us to or we handle it in a manner He did not direct, our service is not acceptable to Him. The first criterion is to be a living and holy sacrifice unto God.

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 25:21, 41-45; Matthew 7:22-27
PRAYER: Lord, I want to serve you; to be a vessel you use for your glory but more importantly, I want to do all that in a way that would be acceptable to you, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Choose God`s way or no way at all.
