Discipline in Money

`Dishonest money dwindles away, but whoever gathers money
little by little makes it grow.` Proverbs 13:11

Text: Proverbs 13:11; 3:9; 22:7.

Discipline in money involves faithfully handling the resources that God has entrusted to us. It entails an understanding of God`s ownership and our responsibility to manage His possessions. It helps us differentiate between wants and needs and the importance of living within our means.
A spending plan is important if we are to control our cash flow and it gives us power over our spending decisions. God`s word teaches that debt enslaves, Proverbs 22:7. So we live debt free by planning ahead, learning contentment and spending according to plan. Discipline in money also involves generosity, shocking but true. This means giving should be a priority (Proverbs 3:9), consistent (1 Corinthians 16:2) and done with a cheerful attitude (2 Corinthians 9:7).

FURTHER STUDY: Luke 12:15; Proverbs 22:7.
PRAYER: Father, teach me to always have the stewardship mentality to all you give me, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: God`s ownership and our stewardship influence our spending decisions.
