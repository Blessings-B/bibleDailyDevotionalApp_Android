Traits of A Disciplined Life

 `Whoever spares the rod hates their children, but the one who loves
their children is careful to discipline them.` Proverbs 13: 24

Text: Proverbs 13:18, 24

Discipline should come from natural consequences, for example, you become disciplined about your eating habits so that you can be fit and healthy; or from the law of cause and effect. It should not come from induced fear, humiliation, shame, yelling or any form of physical or emotional coercion. Disciplined people show the following character traits which last a lifetime;
>Self-control: the ability to delay gratification; doing the right thing even when you don`t feel like it.
>Empathy: developing understanding and care by putting yourself in someone`s shoes; helping people honestly rather than meeting your own agenda at all times.
>Responsibility: being accountable even when no one is watching or keeping records.
>Self-love: an internal sense of worth; confidence derived from within.
>Respect for authority: disciplined people are subject to constituted authority.
>Happy: happy and pleasant to be around.
