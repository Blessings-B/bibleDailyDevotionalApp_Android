When God is Quiet

'My Father and mother MAY abandon me, but the Lord will take care of me.'                                    Psalm 27:10 (GNT)

Text: Psalm 27:10

Divorce is a difficult thing to deal with. For a child, experiencing divorce is akin to facing a violent storm-an internal storm.
Often, Christian children turn to God for help when parents are going through a divorce-we want them back together because a family should stay together, and because we`ve hoped, it is devastating when we feel that God is not going to grant our request. Hope deferred makes the heart sick (Proverbs 13:12) and this sickness can manifest in many ways, including a loss of hope.
Whether we hope for a reunion or stop asking for one, remember that God`s love will always remain unchanged all through the years and He is able to make something beautiful out of every bad situation.

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 77; Romans 8:28
PRAYER: Dear Lord, while I pass through this period of trouble, help me remember that your love is boundless, and your faithfulness is forevermore, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Recall God`s faithfulness in the past. He will see you through this.
