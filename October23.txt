Whose Fault is it?

'Love never gives up; and its faith, hope, and patience never fail'                                                       1 Corinthians 13:7 (GNT)

Text: Romans 5:3-5

I was 7 years old when my parents got officially divorced. It began with the fights, then the long period of silence between family reconciliation meetings. Even though I did not understand what was happening, I felt every crack in our home long before it was final. 
It`s natural to wonder which parent is wrong if we are at fault or why God let this happen. Unfortunately, this can breed hatred for one parent, God and even self-hate. It helps to remember that while our parents` relationship MAY be on shaky grounds (or home broken), it is not God`s desire that any of his creation should experience suffering. But even when this happens, His grace is ever sufficient for us (2 Corinthians 12:19). We might not have all the answers we seek, but we will always have God.

PRAYER: Dear Father, fill me with your Spirit that I may love as you have loved me, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Make a decision to forgive and love your parents despite your pain.
