Our Great Healer

 '...the hard trials that come will not hurt you' Isaiah 43:2 (GNT)

Text: 2 Chronicles 32:9-2

Psychological warfare is not new, in our text, the Emperor of Assyria tried to destroy the confidence of the Israelites by an arrogant show of military strength and lies. Today, the devil still attempts to destroy God`s children through lies.
Having gone through our parent`s divorce, thoughts of unworthiness, guilt, and inadequacies plague us. We MAY even pretend that the whole ordeal had no effect on us. Like Henri Nouwen explains, 'What is forgotten is unavailable, and what is unavailable cannot be healed.'
So even though the pain of divorce MAY be overwhelming, God has shown Himself as our saviour and binder of the broken (Isaiah 61:1). He invites us to find healing and new life in Him.

FURTHER STUDY: Philippians 4:11-13; John 17:13-19; Isaiah 43:1-2
PRAYER: Lord, thank you because You have begun a new work in us-healing, molding and shaping our future, in Jesus name we pray, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: To intentionally face the reality of being broken is not to face defeat, but healing.
