A Perfect Creation

'My frame was not hidden from you when I was being made in secret,
intricately woven in the depths of the earth.'
Psalm 139:15 (ESV)

Text: Psalm 139:1-1

Take a look at the patterns on your palm; no two persons have the same designs nor fingerprints. God shows his love for His creation in the intricacies of their design. Nature attests to His divine engineering, from the seasons of the year and cycle of the moon, to the composition of living cells. The One who has declared His love for the birds and lilies has professed His love for us (John 12:22-31). Little wonder the psalmist exclaimed, 'Your knowledge of me is too deep; it is beyond my understanding.' vs.6 (GNB)
We know that nothing in this world or beyond can separate us from God (Romans 8:39). We can take all our cares to our heavenly Father and believe He will give us peace in exchange for our fears.

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 104; Romans 8:31-39
PRAYER: Father, when life tries to overwhelm me, MAY your hand in creation point me back to you, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: If God takes care of even the tiniest ant, He will take care of you.
