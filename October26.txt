More Than Enough

'I pray that out of his glorious riches he MAY strengthen you with
power through his spirit in your inner being' Ephesians 3:16

Text: Ephesians 3:14-21

Do I need to explain this feeling? The one we`ve so often faced over the years. Those times when you feel unwanted and pathetic; when you have questions and wonder if you will ever be enough. You remember everything wrong in your life and shrink a little more.
Can I tell you that everything you feel are lies from the devil because God`s word declares the opposite? These words of truth are affirmed in His scriptures and the God of the Word desires that you know how much He has poured out His love on you. Feeling unwanted often points to our desire to be loved more. At such times, rather than find acceptance from men, turn to God whose fullness fills all in all.

FURTHER STUDY: Jeremiah 31:3-4; Romans 8:16-17, 38-39
PRAYER: Thank you, Lord, for your Word is the sword that pierces through the lies of the devil.
TIP OF THE DAY: You deserve to be loved and you are deeply loved by God.
