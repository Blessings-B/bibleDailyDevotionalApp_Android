Hope in Future Grace

'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness'    2 Corinthians 12:9

Text: 2 Corinthians 12:1-10

In the 2012 animation series, Avatar: The Legend of Korra, Avatar Korra having faced a life-changing trauma needed help to overcome her depressive state. I still recall how one advice she got reminded me of the Christian`s walk with God: when we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change.
Take a moment to think of the transformative power of change. Plants wither and die in the dry season, but bloom green again when the rain comes. But better than the plants is the child of God who has an everlasting spring of water flowing to renew. This is grace. It is past, present and future sufficiency from the Father in heaven, always available in whatever measure we MAY need.

FURTHER STUDY: Hebrews 6:13-20
PRAYER: When I hit my lowest point, I know that your grace is sufficient for all my needs and I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Thank you, Father, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: In the darkest times, hope is what we give ourselves.
