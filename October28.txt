Tell Your Story

'He helps us in all our troubles, so that we are able to help others who have all kinds of troubles, using the same help that we ourselves have received from God'
2 Corinthians 1:4 (GNT)

Text: 2 Corinthians 1:4

Ernest Hemingway wrote, 'The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places.' Experiencing the divorce of parents is difficult. It comes with tears, fear, anger, a bitter weight, and stigma. While no two persons have the same story, know that God knows your pain and will not let it consume you.
Paul realized that he went through affliction so that he MAY offer comfort to others. He was a man who once despaired of life but learnt to find strength for his weakness in God`s grace, and today Christians find comfort from his story. 
There is great joy in easing the pain of others and comfort in seeking help from people who have walked the same paths and found Christ. Just like Paul, you have been called to share your story.

FURTHER STUDY: 2 Corinthians 4:1-12
PRAYER: Father, I know that with you the pain I feel today will not consume me. Thank you for deeply loving me, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Find fellowship with other children of God.
