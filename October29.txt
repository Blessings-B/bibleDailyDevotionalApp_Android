In Our Own Eyes

`We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes,
and we looked the same to them.`
Numbers 13:33b

Text:  Numbers 13:32-33

Self Esteem is the way we see ourselves and how valuable we think we are. It is possible that (like the Israelites above), the way we think that people see us (unless we have asked them) is not really how they see us but actually how we see ourselves. This MAY be why they said, `we looked the same to them`.
The problem was that the Israelites used their `own eyes`. They forgot to see themselves through God`s eyes. Let us move on from `in our own eyes` to `in God`s eyes`. 

FURTHER STUDY: Isaiah 43:4; Galatians 6:4; Luke 16:15.
PRAYER: Lord, help me to see myself as you see me, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: From your bible, find out at least one thing God says about your looks, abilities, and worth. Write or memorise them and constantly recite them to yourself until you believe them.
