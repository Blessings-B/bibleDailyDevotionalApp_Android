OCTOBER   3rd

Seeds of Love

This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of God`s people
but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.
2 Corinthians 9:12-13

Text: Luke 12:16-21

One of the gifts God places in our hands is a seed which has the power to produce a great harvest. One of such seeds is that of service with the following qualities;
>The seed must be healthy - your seed of service must be devoid of sin and damage (competitive spirit, envy, malice, eye-service). 
>The size of seed is immaterial - ask the mustard seed or Iroko tree. It is not being everywhere that matters but the attitude and heart of service. 
>The soil is carefully chosen -your seed cannot be planted anywhere. You must be guided by the Spirit of God. Locate your place and plant your seed.
>The season of planting is important -There is a time for everything and different seasons for different seeds. 
>The way it is planted counts - It is only the service that is unto God that is acceptable. 
>Nurture is key to the survival of the seed - watch out for neglect; keep up the good work.
