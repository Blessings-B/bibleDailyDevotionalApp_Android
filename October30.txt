Clay Pots

`But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.` 2 Corinthians 4:7

Text: 2 Corinthians 4:6-7

Below is a small quiz for you.

1.Which of these is more valuable?
a.A worn-out raffia bag
b.A new cow-leather bag

You might change your answer if you knew that the raffia bag contains a banknote giving you all the funds you need for the next 15 years and that the leather bag contains a hundred pebbles.
Content matters. 
Although we are clay pots, we carry Christ (the Anointed One and His anointing) inside us. A clay pot is just a clay pot after all. However, our value is based on the treasured Christ within.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Corinthians 1:26-29; Colossians 1:27
PRAYER: Thank you Lord for the value you have placed in me, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: When you think too low of yourself, remember who lives in you and when you think too highly of yourself, remember that you are only a clay pot!
