Thinking of Yourself

`For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought...` Romans 12:3a

Text: Romans 12:3-5

There are things that you are good at and others that you MAY not be so good at. There are people who are better than you in some areas and those you are better than in other areas. That is okay and necessary in life.
That is the way God made it - the eyes for sight, the ears for hearing and gifts for everyone. Recognise your gifts and that of others. Acknowledge your weaknesses and know that God`s grace is made perfect in weakness.

FURTHER STUDY: 2 Corinthians 3:5-6; 2 Corinthians 10:12-13  
PRAYER: Jesus, help me to recognise and use the gifts that you have given me while acknowledging my weaknesses knowing that your grace is sufficient for me. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Be quick to notice something good about people. Give them a sincere compliment.
