Simple Arithmetic

...how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power,
and how he went around doing good Acts 10:38a

Text: Acts 9:36-41

Early school days introduced us to the concept of arithmetic. Where the functions plus and minus were applied in order to modify a figure or status quo. Where there was no desire to bring a change, the number zero was applied. Little did we know that this concept was very applicable to our lives.
When Jesus was on earth, He made a difference and it was a positive one. Scriptures say that he went about `doing good`. In other words, he went about being a plus. That was the same case with Sis. Dorcas who came back from the dead simply for being a plus! This means that we are mandated by God to make a positive or plus difference everywhere we go. You must decide which you want to be and work towards building yourself in that light because it definitely rewards.

FURTHER STUDY: Genesis 12:2-3; Ephesians 4:1; Proverbs 10:7
PRAYER: Lord, you have set an example of doing good for me. Grant me the grace to have that testimony in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Go with this attitude, 'how can I help you today?'
