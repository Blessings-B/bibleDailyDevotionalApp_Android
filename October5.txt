Me? A Bench-Warmer?

Take up the cross, and follow Me.' Mark 10:21b

Text: 2 Kings 5:1-10

Some people act like their eyes are only for looking up. They do not seem concerned with anything happening around them. They pass by and that path does not feel their effect; it`s as if no one passed by. That is not the life God called us to.
In as much as we are not expected to be busy-bodies, meddling in other people`s matters, we are not meant to live as if we were an island.  You are not supposed to sit and watch life pass you by; you are life because Jesus is life. Jesus was a cross-bearer; He got involved. Everywhere He went, He got involved in people`s lives, making it better than He met it by the help of the Holy Spirit. 
The unnamed little girl in our text also did. We are to do likewise; leave things and people better than we met them. It takes love, it takes grace, it takes wisdom, it takes patience and we have all that at our disposal.

TIP OF THE DAY: Get involved!
