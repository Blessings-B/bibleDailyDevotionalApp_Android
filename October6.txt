OCTOBER   6th

I Am Loved

Freely you have received, freely give Matthew 10:8b

Text:	Luke 2:52

As a Christian, do you feel snuggled and warmed by God`s love? Do you often strengthen your heart by recalling how much God must love you in sending Jesus to die on the cross of Calvary or do you feel that you are the only one really concerned about you? Do you often cry with your face stuck in the pillow so that no one would hear? If you do not feel loved, there is no way you can make a difference around you because it is only by love that lives can be touched.
Jesus grew even in favour with God and man and we are expected to have that as a lifestyle. If God could not withhold His best, Jesus from us, He cannot withhold anything good from us. Our temporary circumstances are not a proof of the depth of God`s love. As we receive good, we are to distribute the good in the same measure we received. 

FURTHER STUDY: Romans 5:5; Nehemiah 9:19-25; Romans 8:32 
PRAYER: Lord, there is no doubt that you love me and it is not based on the way I feel. Teach me how to share that love with others, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Accept that God loves you with all your heart and live from that point of view.
