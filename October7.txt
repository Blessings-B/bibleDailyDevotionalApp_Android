OCTOBER   7th

Contacting Grace

...and God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things
at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.
2 Corinthians 9:8

Text:	2 Corinthians 9:10

Man was not wired to function without God. After all, he was created by God and it is the breath of the Almighty God that made him a living being. If he now chooses to separate himself from his maker, He cannot achieve much if anything because whatever he tries to do alone will be discolored by a selfish attitude.
As we wrap up the study on being a blessing, you need to understand that you cannot be such without the help of God- which is called grace. We contacted grace through Jesus Christ when we received Him as our Lord and savior. Someone defined grace as God`s resources at Christ`s expense. God does not expect that we receive the grace and it would have no effect on our lives. However, to be effective, we need to grow in grace and that growth is directly proportional to the depth of revelation or knowledge of God`s Word that we attain. 

FURTHER STUDY: John 15:5; Romans 5:15; 2 Peter 1:2
PRAYER: Lord, I really want to be a blessing. Release your grace upon me through your Word in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Study and meditate on God`s Word every day
