The Lap of Fools

`Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools`. Ecclesiastes 7:9

Text: Ecclesiastes 7:8-9

Think about it - strangers do not sit on the laps of strangers. You might see a child on the laps of the mother, a friend `lapping` a friend when the bus is full or a sibling carrying a younger one, but normal people do not generally sit on the lap of strangers.
The Bible encourages us in the verse above not to be familiar with the emotion of anger. It can cloud our judgement and MAY often lead to violence. Instead, wait. The end of the matter is better than its beginning. The matter we are tempted to be angry about today MAY resolve itself tomorrow or we MAY find a better way to deal with it.

FURTHER STUDY: James 1:20; Ephesians 4:31
PRAYER: Holy Spirit let your presence bring calm to my spirit today in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Whatever you do today; whatever is said to you, do yourself a great favour, count to ten (or twenty) and KEEP CALM.
