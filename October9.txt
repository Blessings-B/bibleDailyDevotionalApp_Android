Speak Up

 `Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves`. Proverbs 31:8a

Text: Proverbs 31:8-9

When that bully in your school or workplace comes again to harass that scared boy or that timid girl, what should you do? The bible says you should speak up. You can stand up for that `voiceless` person. You can get some of your classmates or work colleagues to stand up for that girl or boy - there is strength in numbers.
If that bully is in your own home, please speak up. Tell an older and wise person - an aunt, uncle, pastor or someone of good standing in your community. Be wise about how you speak up but do not keep quiet because sometimes silence is all a bully needs to keep on bullying or to be violent.

FURTHER STUDY: Malachi 2:7; Revelation 1:6
PRAYER: Lord, please give me the courage and wisdom to speak up for the voiceless. Give me a voice of influence today in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: God has made you a royal priest. Act like it - with courage laced with wisdom and humility.
