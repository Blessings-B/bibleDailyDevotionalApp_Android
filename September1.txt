Discipline: An Integral Part of Skill Acquisition.
In everything he did he had great success because the Lord was with him.
I Samuel 18:14

Text: I Samuel 18:5

Correction/discipline is probably one of the most difficult things to accept especially from someone else. David was a man who was anointed to be King, yet he was put in the household of Saul for some training and crucifixion of the flesh. God seems to always put us around people or things like Saul to smoothen out the rough edges till we have learnt discipline.
Just because David was skilled in playing the harp and was a great warrior would not have automatically input discipline into his life. There is always more to learn. Discipline prepares us to be greatly used of God.

FURTHER STUDY: I Kings 7:14-15; Proverbs 23:12
PRAYER: Lord prepare me a workman not ashamed. I pray that I will act wisely in all my ways. I thank you that you will be with me causing me to succeed. 
TIP OF THE DAY: If I keep at it, I`ll get better at doing it.
