SEPTEMBER 10th

Thorns

'and the cares of this world; the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things entering in, choke the word and it becomes unfruitful.' Mark 4:19(NKJV)

Text: Mark 4:10-20

A few years ago, a friend of mine told me about an agricultural business he invested in. He excitedly anticipated the large profits that would come in after the planting season. A few months later, he was telling me about his overwhelming loses which he attributed to different factors including the soil environment of his choice of crop. This story brings to mind the queen of parables: the parable of the soils.
Our study today brings our focus to the seed that fell among thorns. What are these thorns? Which of us has never felt the prick of any these thorns of discontentment in our hearts at one point or the other in our Christian walk? Our Arch-enemy knows how to use even the pressures of legitimate needs to choke our faith and growth in the word of God, but thank God, we are not ignorant of his schemes.

FURTHER STUDY: Luke 12:22-26.
PRAYER: Dear Father, You are the gardener. Please search my heart and take away the thorns that would hinder my growth in You, in Jesus name, Amen.  
TIP OF THE DAY: Guard your heart against the thorns - search God`s word to remind yourself of His promises to you.
