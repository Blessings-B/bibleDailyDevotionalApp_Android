More Thorns

'Then Jesus said to him, `Away from me, Satan! For it is written...' Matthew 4:10

Text: Matthew 4:7-10

This was the last in the series of temptations that Satan brought to our High Priest and Role Model during His wilderness retreat. Picture the physical environment of Jesus: a wilderness with wild animals (Mark 1:13) and Satan bombarding His mind with temptations. Doesn`t life feel like that sometimes? I imagine Jesus taking a little break from this scene to the top of a mountain, the cool evening breeze greeting his skin and the breath-taking slideshow of the most beautiful tourist sites in the world combined with the treasures and glories they had to offer rolling before His eyes. 
I remember explaining to a younger sister that Satan`s offer was actually for Jesus to replace him as the god of this World so that instead of 'worldliness' we would have 'Jesusness'. She stared at me wide-eyed and said 'Oh! Why didn`t He take it?' I replied, 'Because He was content; He didn`t want to sell His future'. Don`t sell yours!

FURTHER STUDY: Revelation 11:15.
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, give me the wisdom to recognize the thorns that Satan brings so that I would overcome like you did.
TIP OF THE DAY: Write down the thoughts that steal your joy when you think of them and begin to thank God for them instead.
