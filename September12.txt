Contentment-101

'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me'.                                                             Philippians 4:13(NKJV)

Text: Philippians 4:10-13

A few years ago, I watched a movie about a wealthy man who treated his guests to a sumptuous feast. Each was to request whatever they wanted. He himself requested a bowl of garri and some groundnuts. He noticed their surprise and explained that 'true wealth is being alive and healthy enough to choose what to eat.' Paul revealed in our passage today that Christian contentment goes beyond the movie`s definition. It is a skill that must be LEARNT by conscious effort and practice.
Our key verse is one of the most quoted-out-of-context motivational verses in the Bible. Imagine us using it in its right context; motivating ourselves in the building of this great virtue. It is the product of a trained spirit; the spirit that enabled Paul to sit in a Roman jail and write to the Philippians with words like 'Joy' and 'Rejoice' filling the lines of this Masterpiece from his grateful heart. Let`s get into God`s Classroom; it`s time to learn how to ABOUND and to ABASE. Let`s get into God`s Gym; it`s time to shed the weights of discontentment. YES, WE CAN.
