The Lying Lion

'Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith...'                                                                               1 Peter 5:9 (NLT)

Text: 1 Peter 5:6-10

In my Primary School days, an elder told us that when a lion wants to hunt, he marks a territory and roars. The smaller animals (who on a normal day are smarter and faster) are struck with fear, so they are too weak to escape and they end up on his dinner plate. I have grown enough to know the finer details (including the fact that the lioness actually does most of the hunting) but the principle still holds true.
Our elder in the faith - Peter, tells us that Satan uses the same principle. He roars around like a lion to fill our hearts with anxiety (the greatest enemy of contentment). I have sat at the counselling table long enough to observe that a great percentage of the things we cry about are rooted in anxiety: It could be night-dreams, career, relationship or family issues. How many lionesses of Zion have lost their purity because of the anxiety of losing a guy? How did Peter teach us to handle this fake-lion? (Resist him steadfastly in the faith). Roar back!

FURTHER STUDY: Mark 4:35-40.
PRAYER: Lion of the tribe of Judah, I am your daughter and I know You always take care of your own. Help me never to forget this!
TIP OF THE DAY: Write down the things you are most anxious about. Thank God for them and tear them up.
