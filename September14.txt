The Lying Lion

'Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith...'                                                                               1 Peter 5:9 (NLT)

Text: 1 Peter 5:6-10

Solomon had the means to experiment with the kind of pleasures that some of us can only fantasize about. He wrote down his findings in Ecclesiastes. In Secondary School Practical Chemistry, we were taught to summarize our experiments in a three-column table: TEST, RESULT, and INFERENCE. Solomon`s practical sheet would have looked like this: 
TEST: All the pleasures of life.
RESULT: No Satisfaction.
INFERENCE: Meaningless/Chasing after the wind.
One of the lies that trigger untamed pursuit of material possessions is that these possessions provide satisfaction. On the contrary, the road of material possession is an endless road; the more you acquire them, the more you see the need to get more. The natural man is an insatiable being, so one of the ways to put a knife to our throat is to always remind oneself that satisfaction is never attained through multiple possessions, but instead, it is a character that is cultivated in Christ.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Kings 10:1-13.
PRAYER: Lord, help me to always remember that satisfaction is only possible in you, in Jesus name I pray, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Compare the things you believe define achievement and satisfaction with the things Solomon achieved.
