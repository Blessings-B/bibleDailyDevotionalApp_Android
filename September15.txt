Jesus` Legacy

Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you... Do not let your hearts be troubled                            and do not be afraid. John 14: 27

Text: John 14:25-29

I lost my dear mother a few months ago, and the pain of the vacuum she left is still fresh in my heart. I miss her deeply, but she left a legacy. Living her godly legacy gives me a blessed feeling like she lives in me every day. 
Jesus was about to leave and like a departing father, He had things to say to His children. Nothing seemed right about this period of their lives. They had left everything to follow Him in hope of a better future. He had taken care of their physical needs for three years but what next now? They knew He had no money stacked up in a foreign account somewhere. Lately, He had started to look burdened (Matthew 26:38). Judas had started to think of a way out (his discontentment eventually opened the door for Satan - Luke 22:3). Jesus had something for them. It was what sustained Him all His years on earth. It was the secret of His ministry success; it was the key to everything: PEACE and Jesus added a clause '...not the type the world gives.'

FURTHER STUDY: Luke 12:15-26.
PRAYER: Dear Lord, You are my shepherd. I receive Your peace, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Jesus said, 'Consider the birds of the air; Consider the lilies.'
