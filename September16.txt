Great Gain

'...some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.' 1 Timothy 6:10 (NKJV)

Text: 1 Timothy 6:5-12

Yesterday we read about the legacy of the Prince of Peace. I am sure you would not be surprised to learn that Paul had a legacy too. It was Paul`s secret which he shared with his Philippian children (Philippians 4:6-7). The Peace of God that passes all mental understanding. It is an impregnable wall that GUARDS our hearts and minds (where the issues of life spring from).
In our text today, Paul phrased it in another way to young Timothy. Warning him against the deceit of Mammon; and to stay away from people who think otherwise, he summarised with an exhortation to 'FIGHT the good fight of FAITH' (to overcome the roaring Lion). Reverse verse 6 and it would read 'ungodliness with discontentment is GREAT LOSS...' Come to think of it, how did Lucifer lose his place of glory in Heaven? Isaiah 14 reveals that he was discontent with his position. Discontentment must be the seed of all evil!

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Thessalonians 5:23.
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, speak peace to my heart, just like you did to the waves and the storm. Strengthen my faith in you today and always, in your name I pray, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Look up the word 'Peace' in a concordance and note five other things the Bible says about peace.
