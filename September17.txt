SEPTEMBER 17th

You Can Master It
Don`t be quick to fly off the handle. Anger boomerangs. You can spot a fool
by the lumps on his head. Ecclesiastes 7:9 (MSG)

Text: Ecclesiastes 7:1-14

Anger is a very strong emotion. Strong emotions like love and hate have the ability to make us act in unexpected ways. But we do not have to be a slave to our emotions. Through the power of God`s word and by the help of the Holy Spirit, we can learn to master them.
For the next 6 days, we shall look at what the bible says about anger and how we can deal with it.  Our key verse tells us that the result of an angry outburst is not pretty.  It always bounces back. 

FURTHER STUDY: James 1:19-27; Galatians 5:22-23
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, you died to give me victory over sin and sinful emotions. I refuse to let anger control me. By your word and power, I will walk in victory. Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Rather than saying or doing something you might regret later, walk away or, count to fifty until you feel calmer.
