'In your anger, do not sin. Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry'. Ephesians 4:26

Text: Ephesians 4:17-32

Grace stopped in her tracks, staring at her bed in shock. Her favourite turquoise gown which had been borrowed for a wedding by her roommate lay on the bed, with a burn mark at the hem, possibly made by an iron.  Anger welled up in her heart like a coiled snake preparing to strike.
At this point, Grace had a choice to make. Turn to her friend and shout all manner of insults at her including promising never to lend her anything ever again.  Or calm down, find out what caused it, acknowledge that accidents happen and forgive her friend. What would Jesus want her to do? 

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 16:32; Psalm 37:8-9
PRAYER: Dear Lord, help me to refrain from anger and to be slow to speak especially when I`m angry, in Jesus name. Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Remember you do not know the whole story. So, stop and listen before jumping to conclusions.
