Do Not Give It a Chance
'...and do not give the devil a foothold'. Ephesians 4:27

Text: Ephesians 4:17-32

A mouse in a pet shop looks very cute. However, a pair of mice in the home can cause havoc when they reproduce. They nibble at everything, get into places they shouldn`t and are a serious nuisance. At this point, your parents will need to pay an exterminator to get rid of the mice.
Unresolved anger towards a person is like mice infestation in the home. It gives the devil a foothold in your life where he can wreak all kinds of havoc. God wants us to quickly resolve and forgive people who offend us.  Not just for their sake but also for ours. Forgiveness causes us to let go of our anger and trust God to turn the situation around for our good. 

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 5:43-48; Ecclesiastes 10:8; Psalm 37:8-9
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, help me to let go of the anger I feel and to forgive just as you forgave me. Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Pray for someone who has offended you and forgive sincerely.
