Text: Psalm 143:3-10

For some of us getting into university after leaving secondary school was or has been a challenge. This can be very discouraging but it is not the time to give up on your dreams. Rather it is a time to stop evaluate and re-strategize. Get help where you need help and work towards your goals.
While doing this discover, learn and develop ass many skills as you can. Don`t waste this time. Learn to bake, sew, write, organise events execute projects, be part of and lead a team. The skills you learn and perfect in this golden opportunity would be of immeasurable help later on in life. 

FURTHER STUDY: Philippians 4:6-7
PRAYER: Father MAY my strength never fail in times of difficulty. MAY your joy keep my mind and soul in Christ, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: I will encourage myself in the Lord.
