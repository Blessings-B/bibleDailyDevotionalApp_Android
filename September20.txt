Keep the Right Company

Do not make friends with a hot-tempered person; do not associate with one easily angered. Proverbs 22:24

Text: Proverbs 22:24-25

A popular quote says 'Show me your friends and I`ll show you who you are.' This is actually based on a biblical concept. In Proverbs 13:20, Solomon, the wise-guy, wrote: 'He that walks with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.'
If your close friends are quick to take offence at every little thing, lose their temper easily, cannot control their tongues or their actions, raise their voices at the slightest offence, it becomes difficult for you to maintain a calm composure around them. Slowly but surely, you will adopt their bad behaviours. Choose friends, who encourage you to keep your cool, maintain a calm composure, practice patience, self-control and respond with kind words when faced with an offence.

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 13:20; 1 Corinthians 15:33
PRAYER: Lord Jesus, please surround me with friends that encourage me to practice patience and self-control if I am tempted to lose my temper.  Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: A true friend always encourages you to do what is right.
