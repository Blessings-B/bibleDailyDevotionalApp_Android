Our Words Matter
'... The simple moral fact is that words kill.'   Matthew 5:22 (MSG)

Text: Matthew 5:21-48

We are responsible for how we react when someone does or says something to offend us.  We can either reply in anger or with a blessing.  A word said in anger or hurt has the potential to cause months, even years of damage both to the speaker and the hearer.
When people offend you, focus on God instead of becoming angry. Remember that God wants you to keep your attention on Him and not on the situation. The words we speak in tense situations should reflect our trust in God. They should be words of blessing and not anger.

FURTHER STUDY: Proverbs 15:1; Colossians 3:8
PRAYER: Lord, help me to keep my eyes fixed on you when I am tempted to lose my temper. Help me to speak words of blessing and not words that will stir up strife, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Try saying 'God bless you' when you are tempted to say something negative in anger. Keep saying it until the anger subsides.
