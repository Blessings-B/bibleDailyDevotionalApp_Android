Practice Makes Perfect

'Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. Matthew 7:24

Text: Matthew 7:24-29

God wants us to live right and has given us His Word (the Bible) which teaches us how to live right. When we read the Bible and we live the way it says we should, we are building a strong foundation of good habits and right living.
This foundation is what we need to help us when we are tempted to become angry and to lose our temper. The more you study God`s word, meditate (think about) it, and do it, the better you become at controlling your temper.

FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 119:9-16; James 1:19-27 
PRAYER: Dear Jesus, Your Word is what I need to train me to live and act right. Help me to study your Word and put it into practice. Amen.  
TIP OF THE DAY: Read at least one chapter of your bible every day.
