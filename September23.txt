Practice Makes Perfect

'Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. Matthew 7:24

Text: Matthew 7:24-29

For many of us, anger is our reaction to the dissatisfactions of life.  We feel something and we react to it without thinking of the consequences.
If you have given Jesus control of your life, then you have the Holy Spirit living in your spirit. You can ask Him to help you deal with angry feelings and angry outbursts. And do you know what? He will help you because He loves you and wants you to be free to live a life filled with the love and joy of the Lord. 
All you have to do is ask Him now. Yes, today! And He will help you put aside all the anger and every negative feeling which does not glorify God. He`s your Helper!

FURTHER STUDY: I Peter 5:8; Colossians 3:8 
PRAYER: Holy Spirit, when I am tempted to get angry, help me be calm, to respond in love and not react in anger in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Ask Him for help today.
