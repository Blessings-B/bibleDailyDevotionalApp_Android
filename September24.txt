Living with Intention

Be careful, then how you live-not as unwise but as wise.
Ephesians 5:15

Text: Luke 14:28-35

We`ve heard the phrase `live with intention` often enough, but what many are not aware of, is that it finds its roots in the bible. While Jesus was speaking to the crowd, he referenced following him to projects like building a house-will a man not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it? vs 28
Likewise, our journey through this world should be treated as a long-term project. Everyone must keep in sight the finish line, which could be something as simple as getting through school with good grades or making it into heaven when our Lord comes. Every decision made should take us one step closer to that destination, rather than farther away from it. Even on this very vital and emotional issue whatever your decision, keep your destination in mind. Would that choice (person) draw you closer to God or away from him?
