SEPTEMBER 25th

A Slow Dance

...the way of a man with a young woman. Proverbs 30:19

Text: Songs of Solomon 2:8-9

Did it happen to you? Or it hasn`t yet? It seems like you wake up one day and the boys in your neighborhood just seem to become more interesting. And not just in the regular we all love movies kind of way but in a do I look all right kind of way? Lol! It usually comes up right about the same time our bodies and emotions start changing, heralding the arrival of puberty. Relax, it`s only natural a part of God`s design but as Ecclesiastes tells us there is a time for everything. 
Till we are of marriageable age we should focus on learning to build friendships that stand the test of time. The skills and experience you learn from these friendships become the building blocks for all meaningful relationships in the future.

FURTHER STUDY: Genesis 24
PRAYER: Heavenly Father thank you for your plans for me, I give you praise because you will make even this beautiful in its time, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Make building strong and meaningful friendships a priority.
