SEPTEMBER 26th

Heartstrings
Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
Songs of Solomon 8:4

Text: Songs of Solomon 8:1-7

One of the most important questions we ask is 'when is the right time to love?' There are some who posit that love simply happens to a person and others who consider it a more conscious effort. But whichever position we take, Solomon Songs admonishes us to hold back on awakening love until it so desires. This charge is in fact so crucial that it appears three times! Songs of Solomon 2:7; 3:5; 8:4. 
Why are we charged to guard our heart against love until it is ready? The Song likens love to tending a vineyard (Songs of Solomon 2:15). It takes time and attention and hard work, and at the wrong time, rather than love being something to cherish, it could become a great distraction. 
The right time to love then will be when we are most equipped to handle its needs-in other words when we are ready to pursue a relationship that leads to marriage.

PRAYER: Thank you, Lord, for giving everything its own time. Help me to guard my heart and wait for the right time, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Don`t be someone in love with the idea of love. Wait until you understand what it entails.
