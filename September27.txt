The Price of Love
Love never fails... 1 Corinthians 13:8a

Text: 1 Corinthians 13

To the one who receives, love is free. To the one who gives, love can cost a lot. A look at God`s relationship with man paints a worthy picture of the demands of love. In Genesis, God made man in his own image and placed him the Eden with an eternal supply of all his needs. Shortly after man sinned and got tossed out of the garden. Yet, because of His love, God began making plans of reconciliation through Jesus, who fulfilled our salvation through death on the cross.
Think about this in the context of romantic relationships among people. The bible teaches husbands to love their wives as Christ loved the church, and wives to respect their husbands. Can you think of the work and sacrifice that love entails; can you imagine the price of love to a teenager-the distraction, emotional drama and possible temptations? The bible teaches there is a time for everything. When the time is right, love that leads to marriage is a beautiful thing to treasure but until then let`s keep it as a dream to aspire to.

PRAYER: Heavenly Father, help me to learn to love the way you love, in Jesus name, Amen. 
TIP OF THE DAY: Have you shown love the 1 Corinthians 13 way?
