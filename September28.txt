Can We Be Friends?

Everything is permissible, but not everything is beneficial. 1 Corinthians 10:23

Text: 1 Corinthians 10:23

Most friendships between the opposite sexes start off innocently. Back in primary school, my best friend kept me on my toes academically same way I did for him. Eventually, our classmates would begin to call us a couple and even though that was not the original intention of our relationship, romantic feelings began to put a wedge between us.
These things are quite common for young children, however, like the scripture admonishes, not all things are beneficial to us. There are a number of challenges that go with close friendships with members of the opposite sex. Chief among these is unreciprocated feelings, which MAY be psychologically harmful to us.
We can prevent this by being truthful about our reasons for pursuing friendships with the opposite sex and judge those reasons against what is right. Certain kinds of relationships are better pursued with the experience of age and safety of wise counsel. And when the right time comes, we can be assured God will send the right person to lead us in this beautiful dance called love.

FURTHER STUDY: Ecclesiastes 3; Songs of Solomon 2:7
PRAYER: Help me Lord to maintain relationships that give you glory, rather than that which pleases me.
TIP OF THE DAY: Friendships that glorify Him are God`s desire for us.
