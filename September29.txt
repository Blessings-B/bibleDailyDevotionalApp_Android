SEPTEMBER 29th

Boundary Lines

... So that you MAY be able to discern what is best and MAY be pure and
blameless until the day of Christ' Philippians 1:10

Text: Exodus 20:3-17

Boundaries are what define our identities. Every country has boundary lines on land, air and water bodies. These lines tell trespassers that they have walked into the property of another person.
Likewise, every relationship needs definition-this means setting boundaries and demanding that the other party respects them, as much as we are accountable to them. It also means refusing to tolerate actions that go against our personal identity. To do this, every child must know where they are headed as defined in God`s word. 
In our study text, because God knew his plans, He set boundaries for the children of Israel to define His relationship with them and expectations by giving the Ten Commandments. Just like God, we need boundaries that clearly define every form of relationship from the beginning in love and respect. Wisdom requires some no`s in order to maintain safety and integrity that leads to life, and not the liberty that leads to sin.

FURTHER STUDY: Mark 9:42-50; Galatians 5:22-23
PRAYER: Heavenly Father, I know I find my identity in you. Help me communicate this in the most loving way to others, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Present yourself to your friends as God sees you: holy and blameless. Ask God for wisdom to set godly boundaries.
