Why Bother with College?

To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions
and dreams of all kinds. Daniel 1:17

Text: 2 Timothy 1:6-10

Paul in the scriptures above spends time admonishing Timothy, encouraging him to live the best life possible.  In our main text, He encourages Timothy to fan the flames of the gift within him. He admonished Timothy on how to sustain this gift impacted by faith; he encourages him to study the word. Fanning the flames of a gift can only be done through a process of exploring, practicing and refining our knowledge of that gift.
We all have gifts, talents, and skills but unless we put in the effort to harness them through diligent study we might lose them or underutilize them. God gave an understanding of all kinds of literature and learning to the Hebrew boys and He can do the same with us. Going to college is not a guarantee that all things will fall into place, but it is certain to increase your knowledge base and open your eyes to opportunities further afield. 

FURTHER STUDY: Daniel 1:11-21; 2 Timothy 2:15 
PRAYER: Dear Lord help me to lay aside every restless or distracting thought. Give me the strength to discipline my mind so I MAY apply it to knowledge, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: There is nothing to be lost from positively improving our knowledge base; apply your mind to studying.
