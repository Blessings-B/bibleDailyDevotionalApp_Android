Honouring God in Our Relationships

Do not be conformed any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed
by the renewing of your mind. Romans 12:2a

Text: Romans 12:1-2

Most of what we`ve talked about over the past few days center on having a godly relationship with one another. To do this we need wisdom that enables us to set focused targets, choose the right relationships and set godly boundaries that do not encourage the ambiguity that leads to sin.
So how do we achieve this? In our text Paul, encourages us to present our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God (vs 1). We can do this by acknowledging the cost of our salvation and recognizing that now we live not for ourselves, but for God. The next step calls for a complete transformation by a renewal of the mind. We can change the way we think and mannerism by spending more time studying God`s word. God`s word is light and understanding to all who seek to know His will.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 John 2; James 1:12
PRAYER: Father, thank you for setting me aside to lead a perfect life through grace. Let my relationships build godly communities that invite others to you, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: are there relationships that leave you feeling unworthy of God`s presence? Some pruning is definitely in order.
