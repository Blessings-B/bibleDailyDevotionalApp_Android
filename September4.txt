SEPTEMBER 4th

Finishing Strong Starts at The Beginning.

But he who stands firm to the end will be saved. Matthew 24:13

Text: Luke 14:28-35

I suspect everyone has heard about Ussain Bolt, one of the best, if not the best athlete to have emerged in this decade. It is amazing to watch him on the tracks. He never seems ruffled or scared and once that signal is given, his concentration and attack of the racing track are intense.
Sports commentators constantly marvel at how fast he leaves the starting line, stays focused and does not waver till the end. When you look at his face at the finish line it is almost as relaxed as it was at the starting line. This tells me that the race is not just about that day but all about the hours of practice put in ahead of time. To finish strong, you must start strong; pick the right friends, the right fellowship, and a good study plan.

FURTHER STUDY: Luke 9:50-62; Ecclesiastes 9:11; 1 Corinthians 9:24-27 
PRAYER: Dear Lord, grant me the grace not to look back or waiver in my pursuit of your will for my future, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Take the time to set a goal for yourself, spiritually, academically and socially; choose how you want to finish now.
