SEPTEMBER 5th

Standing for Christ In My Studies
Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve before kings;
he will not serve before obscure men. Proverbs 22:29

Text: Proverbs 1:28-33

Study as though your success in life solely depends on your study and pray as though your success in life solely depends on your prayers. I found this saying very helpful through my university days. It made me trust God for grace over things I just could not understand and appreciate Him more for the things I easily breezed through. It also made me aware that I could never expect God to do things for me that I should do for myself.
When we excel in our academics, we attract men to Christ because we will prove that an excellent spirit dwells in every born-again child of God. From the main text, God expects us to stand by the principles of His Word even as we gather knowledge. This includes not cheating, not ignoring our lectures or assignments; being diligent and as consistent as possible with our studies.

FURTHER STUDY: Daniel 6:3; Exodus 36:1-2; 2 Chronicles 2:13-14  
PRAYER: Lord MAY I understand that to excel as a student is one of the ways I can preach the good news to my classmates, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Ensure you have good grades and when you are asked the secret, point to Jesus!
