Standing for Christ In My Relationships
Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord. Hebrews 12:14 (NKJV)

Text: Matthew 5:13-24

I would like you to consider the following words: A bitter virgin, an abusive priest, a neglectful mother. These are words that should not exist together. They are indications that the individuals involved do not understand the value of their position or the trust placed on them by God, society, their followers or beliefs. In this same manner is a Christian who does not speak or demonstrate the life of Christ in their relationships.
Regardless of the relationships on campus, we must endeavor to live out the principles of holiness, forgiveness, love, and honesty in all that we do. To get it right in one area but fail in another is to light a lamp (your faith and good deeds) but hide it under a bushel (areas of neglect). However, remember not to trust in the arm of your flesh but rather in the grace of God.

FURTHER STUDY: Isaiah 41:8-22; 1 Thessalonians 5:14-15, 22; 2 Corinthians 5:20 
PRAYER: Lord thank you for the gift of people. MAY I represent you well and be a true ambassador for you on campus and beyond, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: The Bible encourages us to live in peace with everyone, but it does not mean we should compromise God`s standards at any point.
