 SEPTEMBER 7th

Standing for Christ In My Environment

In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they MAY see your
good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. Matthew 5:16

Text: 1 Peter 2: 10 - 15

The Queen of England remains one of the longest living monarchs of the century. A lot of people regardless of their wealth consider it a privilege to meet with her, even if it is just for a handshake. When I look at my wardrobe or check the words I speak I often ask myself if I was going to meet the queen, would I feel dignified enough in this and if the answer is no then I reconsider my actions.
In a similar manner, we must reconsider our conduct wherever we find ourselves on campus; is the action, this business deal, this study plan, this relationship, this election worthy of a princess on an ambassadorial visit? Is my conduct aligned with the Bible`s standards? Is it worthy of display in the public and private places? God expects me to represent Him in thoughts, word, and deed.

FURTHER STUDY: Matthew 5:13-18; 1 Peter 2:19-23; Ruth 2:11-12  
PRAYER: Heavenly father help me to do your word in all my daily interaction, help me to stand even when it seems like no one is around, in Jesus name I pray, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Do not be like the electric pole with wires that supplies no current, fully release the Christ in you.
