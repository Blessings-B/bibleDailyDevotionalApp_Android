SEPTEMBER 8th

A Well-Rounded Adult
Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the grave,
where you are going, there is neither working nor planning
nor knowledge nor wisdom. Ecclesiastes 9:10

Text: Luke 2: 39 -53.

I went to a birthday party last summer; the cake was one of the most elaborate princess themed cake I had ever seen. The three-tiered castle cake served as a wonderful home to Princess Elsa, Anna, Olaf and other fondant characters from the Disney classic Frozen. However, when it was time to eat the cake we were advised not to eat the middle as it was not fully baked. The cake tasted lovely and I thoroughly enjoyed it but looking back now I cannot help thinking that this is how the life of some Christians are; perfect on the outside but lacking within.
God does not want us to be that way, He wants us to be the same within as without, nothing lacking or missing. Does this mean we should lose hope and give up? No. it means we keep trusting in God`s grace to get us where He wants us to be.

FURTHER STUDY: 1 Samuel 2:26; 1 Thessalonians 4:11-12; 2 Timothy 3:16-17 
PRAYER: Dear Father, help me not to grow not only in stature but also in inner strength, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Whatever is worth doing is worth doing well, so whatever life you choose to live is worth living well in line with God`s word.
