Staying Strong

Finally, brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.
Ephesians 6:10 (KJV)

Text: 2 Peter 1:1-9.

Never judge a book by its cover or an ant by its size. As tiny as they are, ants can carry things that are ten times their size. Inner strength, a confidence that comes from within; from knowing whose you are is what we need to survive the various changes we face in college.
This includes grades that do not measure up to our efforts, financial constraints, failed relationships we had hoped would endure and reward us, etc. Staying strong means never thinking you have `arrived`. It means focusing on God because His joy is our strength. We will only attain perfection when we stand before the throne of grace, until then we must continually add to our love patience, and to patience knowledge, and to knowledge kindness etc. There are no `old Christians` before God; we all still have room to grow and blossom and that we should.

FURTHER STUDY: Zechariah 4; Philippians 3:12-16; 1 Corinthians 10:12-13  
PRAYER: Father I pray that your grace will hold me through good days and bad days, learning to celebrate every day because You are with me, in Jesus name, Amen.
TIP OF THE DAY: Daily reaffirm the blessings and opportunities God has given you; build up your confidence bank.
